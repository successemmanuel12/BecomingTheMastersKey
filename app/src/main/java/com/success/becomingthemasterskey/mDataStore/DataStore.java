                "Let’s begin with the first key.\n\n" +
                "GIVING: THE FIRST KEY\n" +
                "   By opening to the first verse of Chapter Six of " +
                "Matthew, we find Jesus telling His disciples and all those " +
                "listening, including the Pharisees:\n\n" +
                    "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to " +
                    "be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of " +
                    "your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when " +
                    "thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet " +
                    "before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues " +
                    "and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. " +
                    "Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But " +
                    "when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know " +
                    "what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be " +
                    "in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret " +
                    "himself shall reward thee openly.\n\n" +
                "   Since Jesus begins by talking about giving, in the form " +
                "of alms, we need to define some terms.\n" +
                "Let us begin by understanding what “alms” means. " +
                "One source, Nelson’s illustrated Bible dictionary defines " +
                "it this way: “money given out of mercy for the poor.” " +
                "This source goes on to say, “by Jesus’ time, the word " +
                "“righteousness” was tied closely to the word “alms.”\n" +
                "   So we might paraphrase the first verse by saying that " +
                "when we give, in order to be counted righteous, our " +
                "motive should be to please God and not man. Jesus " +
                "implies that giving is expected but the motive behind " +
                "the gift is most important.\n" +
                "   I believe Jesus is teaching this to reveal a much deeper " +
                "truth. Jesus is saying that the very beginning stage of " +
                "our development, as a disciple is determined by how " +
                "and why we give.\n" +
                "Jesus said later in the same book of Matthew, in 26:11 " +
                "that the poor will always be around. So, giving to the " +
                "poor is not the main issue, it is the heart He is after. The " +
                "poor are the visible means by which our hearts are " +
                "being tried; money becomes a way to measure our " +
                "obedience.\n" +
                "Jesus will ask every one of us if we understand the " +
                "price that has been paid for our salvation.\n" +
                "   He asks this through many ways, but the most basic " +
                "is through our tithes and offerings. The issue of giving is " +
                "elementary to each of us who know the price Jesus paid. " +
                "If we have not gone to depths of understanding the cross " +
                "and the price associated with our Savior, then giving " +
                "will always be a problem.\n" +
                "   Giving is so much more than leaving your money in " +
                "an envelope or offering plate. True giving comes from an " +
                "attitude that understands the depth of what our Lord " +
                "and Savior has done. True giving is determined not only " +
                "by the amount we bring before the Lord but by the " +
                "amount we keep for ourselves.\n" +
                "   Our demonstration of gratitude is meant to be a " +
                "continual offering before God in every part of our life. " +
                "For example, parents don’t give to their children because " +
                "of rules established by books and experts. Parents give " +
                "because they are flesh and blood of their offspring and " +
                "the needs of their children are more important than " +
                "their own. This type of relationship is what makes the " +
                "family a family and creates harmony and security " +
                "among its members.\n" +
                "   We find this type of relationship or covenant all " +

                "commitment so what did He do?\n\n" +
                    "For when God made a promise to Abraham, " +
                    "because He could swear by no one greater, He swore " +
                    "by Himself, saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, " +
                    "and multiplying I will multiply you.” And so, after " +
                    "he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. " +
                    "For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath " +
                    "for confirmation is for them an end of all disputes. " +
                    "Thus God, determining to show more abundantly " +
                    "to the heirs of promise the immutability of His " +
                    "counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two " +

                "   This is the type of love that produces passion in one’s " +

                "   Absolutely all of us, every breathe we take, every beat " +

                "W hen that realization consumes us, the struggle over " +
                "why and how much to give becomes no struggle. We are " +
                "in submission to the Holy Spirit. If the truth that God " +

                "   Is our heavenly Father capable to provide more than " +

                "   Perhaps this is why there has been so much teaching " +

                "which was measured in dollars, to being measured in " +
                "obedience. The amount becomes secondary to the " +

                    "he said, “Here I am.” Then He said, “Take now your " +

                "not even get to the place of giving the most precious " +

                "   This key of “giving” is the first and most important " +
                "because without it no other key is available to us. This is " +
                "why if we just think of it in terms of money we have " +
