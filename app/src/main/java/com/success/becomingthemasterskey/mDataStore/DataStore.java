                "Let’s begin with the first key.\n\n" +
                "GIVING: THE FIRST KEY\n" +
                "   By opening to the first verse of Chapter Six of " +
                "Matthew, we find Jesus telling His disciples and all those " +
                "listening, including the Pharisees:\n\n" +
                    "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to " +
                    "be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of " +
                    "your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when " +
                    "thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet " +
                    "before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues " +
                    "and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. " +
                    "Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But " +
                    "when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know " +
                    "what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be " +
                    "in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret " +
                    "himself shall reward thee openly.\n\n" +
                "   Since Jesus begins by talking about giving, in the form " +
                "of alms, we need to define some terms.\n" +
                "Let us begin by understanding what “alms” means. " +
                "One source, Nelson’s illustrated Bible dictionary defines " +
                "it this way: “money given out of mercy for the poor.” " +
                "This source goes on to say, “by Jesus’ time, the word " +
                "“righteousness” was tied closely to the word “alms.”\n" +
                "   So we might paraphrase the first verse by saying that " +
                "when we give, in order to be counted righteous, our " +
                "motive should be to please God and not man. Jesus " +
                "implies that giving is expected but the motive behind " +
                "the gift is most important.\n" +
                "   I believe Jesus is teaching this to reveal a much deeper " +
                "truth. Jesus is saying that the very beginning stage of " +
                "our development, as a disciple is determined by how " +
                "and why we give.\n" +
                "Jesus said later in the same book of Matthew, in 26:11 " +
                "that the poor will always be around. So, giving to the " +
                "poor is not the main issue, it is the heart He is after. The " +
                "poor are the visible means by which our hearts are " +
                "being tried; money becomes a way to measure our " +
                "obedience.\n" +
                "Jesus will ask every one of us if we understand the " +
                "price that has been paid for our salvation.\n" +
                "   He asks this through many ways, but the most basic " +
                "is through our tithes and offerings. The issue of giving is " +
                "elementary to each of us who know the price Jesus paid. " +
                "If we have not gone to depths of understanding the cross " +
                "and the price associated with our Savior, then giving " +
                "will always be a problem.\n" +
                "   Giving is so much more than leaving your money in " +
                "an envelope or offering plate. True giving comes from an " +
                "attitude that understands the depth of what our Lord " +
                "and Savior has done. True giving is determined not only " +
                "by the amount we bring before the Lord but by the " +
                "amount we keep for ourselves.\n" +
                "   Our demonstration of gratitude is meant to be a " +
                "continual offering before God in every part of our life. " +
                "For example, parents don’t give to their children because " +
                "of rules established by books and experts. Parents give " +
                "because they are flesh and blood of their offspring and " +
                "the needs of their children are more important than " +
                "their own. This type of relationship is what makes the " +
                "family a family and creates harmony and security " +
                "among its members.\n" +
                "   We find this type of relationship or covenant all " +
                "through scripture. So when God made covenant with " +
                "man He knew man could never keep this level of " +
                "commitment so what did He do?\n\n" +
                    "For when God made a promise to Abraham, " +
                    "because He could swear by no one greater, He swore " +
                    "by Himself, saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, " +
                    "and multiplying I will multiply you.” And so, after " +
                    "he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. " +
                    "For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath " +
                    "for confirmation is for them an end of all disputes. " +
                    "Thus God, determining to show more abundantly " +
                    "to the heirs of promise the immutability of His " +
                    "counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two " +
                    "immutable things, in which it is impossible for God " +
                    "to lie.\n\n" +

                "   This is the type of love that produces passion in one’s " +
                "heart to give all. This type of giving comes from the " +
                "understanding that nothing I have belongs to me.\n" +
                "   Absolutely all of us, every breathe we take, every beat " +

                "W hen that realization consumes us, the struggle over " +
                "why and how much to give becomes no struggle. We are " +
                "in submission to the Holy Spirit. If the truth that God " +
                "has pledged Himself to our success becomes a reality, " +
                "the pursuit of our selfish agenda becomes abnormal and " +

                "   Is our heavenly Father capable to provide more than " +
                "we possibly could? Absolutely, yet in the average " +
                "Christian life “giving” seems to be a major area of not " +

                "   Perhaps this is why there has been so much teaching " +
                "on faith, particularly in the area of our finances. I totally " +

                "message and have done their best to train us in the " +
                "scriptures concerning faith. This has prepared us to " +

                "   In my life I have observed my faith in the beginning, " +
                "which was measured in dollars, to being measured in " +
                "obedience. The amount becomes secondary to the " +

                    "Now it came to pass after these things that God " +
                    "tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And " +
                    "he said, “Here I am.” Then He said, “Take now your " +

                "   This offering had nothing to do with money and " +
                "everything to do with value. In our life we sometimes do " +
                "not even get to the place of giving the most precious " +
                "“thing” we posses as Abraham did.\n" +
                "   For example, when was the last time your giving " +

                "   This key of “giving” is the first and most important " +
                "because without it no other key is available to us. This is " +
                "why if we just think of it in terms of money we have " +
                "totally misunderstood our Lord; our Heavenly Father " +
                "demonstrated why to give and what amount to give in " +
                "John 3:16.\n\n" +
                    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only " +

                "   The true standard of giving is set by the One, whom " +
                "through our conversion, requires our life for His. If we " +
                "do not understand the price paid by our Father, our " +
                "ability to give is dramatically diminished. This is why a " +
                "constant reminder of the cross is so critical for our " +
                "repentance of anything associated with selfishness. I " +
                "believe, giving is the first and most powerful key to " +
                "understand.\n" +
                "   Our opening verse speaks about giving in secret, " +
                "which causes God to reward the giver in open.\n" +
                "   In 1 Corinthians 2:7 Paul said what God did was a " +
                "mystery to the powers in control of this planet. Paul " +
                "was of course speaking of the crucifixion of Jesus that " +
                "was done in secret dethroning the “powers and " +
                "principalities of this world.”\n" +
                "   And just like Jesus revealed in Matthew 6:4, God is " +
                "now rewarding Himself openly with a future bride for " +
                "His Son.\n" +
                "   Can you see the wisdom and beauty of this design? " +
                "His love for mankind was so deep and the pain of " +
                "separation so intense that He gave the best gift He had " +
                "with the purest of motives, in secret. Now what has " +
                "been done in secrete is bearing fruit for the entire world " +
                "to see. The true bride is being displayed for the entire " +
                "world to see. This fruit, called the “Body of Christ” will " +

                "of history. Jesus is preparing a perfect “Body” that will " +
                "move through this earth like a hot knife through butter. " +
                "The revelation that is being poured out right now will " +
                "equip all who are willing to destroy the works of the " +
                "enemy. This army will move into a level of faith that we " +
                "all have read about in the Scriptures. The faith of the " +
                "giants recorded in Hebrews will become realized by a " +
                "generation that understands the keys of the kingdom " +
                "being released at this time in history.\n" +
                "   Let’s look at the supernatural force behind faith and\n" +
                "how it is released:\n\n" +
                    "But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for " +
                    "he who comes to God must believe that He is, and " +
                    "that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek " +

                "not everyone today is coming with the purest of " +
                "motives.\n" +
                "   Our Heavenly Father wants every human being to " +
                "experience Him as more than willing and able to take " +
                "care of our every need. His method of showing us this is " +
                "demonstrated by our willingness to trust Him (faith) in " +
                "the secret place (unseen).\n" +
                "   We will keep returning to the motives of our heart. If " +
                "we truly have experienced the depth, width, height and " +
                "length (or dimensions) of the love of Christ, our motives " +
                "will move from the seen realm to the unseen realm. The " +
                "unseen realm requires a currency called faith to access " +
                "the Father. One translation of Hebrews 11 says, “Faith " +
                "means being sure of the things we hope for and knowing " +
                "that something is real even if we do not see it.”\n" +
                "   Any growth we make in the unseen realm is always " +
                "by faith. We must give what we can see as a deposit in " +
                "the realm we cannot see. Then the Father, knowing how " +
                "we train children, gives us a reward to reinforce our " +
                "efforts of faith. Then He will train us to totally trust Him " +
                "with everything we hold valuable, as He did Abraham.\n" +
                "   This is why Jesus began the chapter with the most " +
                "elementary key called “giving.” If we can not " +
                "understand this level or are not willing to give back to " +
                "Him everything He has entrusted to us, it will be " +
                "impossible to receive the next “key.”\n" +
                "   Remember, each key is critical if we are to advance " +
                "beyond our ineffective Christian lives to enter the " +
                "heavenly places God has provided for us through Jesus. " +
                "These “places” require “keys” to unlock doors that have " +
                "been shut as a result of our disobedient ancestors, " +
                "beginning with Adam. Jesus came that we might have " +
                "abundant life which is far beyond “big houses and " +
                "cars.” Look what Jesus said in John 10:10. A thief comes " +
                "to steal and kill and destroy, but I came to give life—life " +
                "in all its fullness.\n\n" +
                "   This is the life of watching the Father, as Jesus did, " +
                "doing as He does, and obeying as He did. Jesus knew that " +
                "on earth there would be many different circumstances " +
                "and influences continually bidding for His attention, but " +
                "He knew His purpose, and that kept Him focused. But He " +
                "also knew that His Father was the sole authority in His " +
                "life, and if He watched His Father, there would be no " +
                "surprises from the thief.\n" +
                "   Jesus is our role model, and everything He said and " +
                "did were examples or demonstrations of how to live for " +
                "the Father. This would be impossible without the Holy " +
                "Spirit, but Jesus knew that and made arrangements for " +
                "the precious Holy Spirit to take us into even greater " +
                "dimensions than He Himself.\n" +
                "   As a parent, I want my son to go farther and reach " +
                "higher than me and that is what Jesus said, “Greater " +
                "works shall you do.” What a wonderful Savior is ours.\n" +
                "   There are many different levels of giving, but we will " +
                "look at only three.\n\n" +
                "1. GIVING TO GET\n\n" +
                "Most Christians are taught that God is a giver and He " +
                "will always give you more than you give Him. The " +
                "“prosperity” message has built large Churches and " +
                "filled big auditoriums with Christians looking for a " +
                "better life and thrilled with the idea of lots of money. All " +
                "the Scriptures quoted by the so-called “prosperity” " +
                "crowd are legitimate and indeed speak of the desire of " +
                "the Father to take care of His children, royally.\n\n" +
                    "A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s " +
                    "children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for " +
                    "the just.\n\n" +
                "                                        —Proverbs 13:22\n\n" +
                "   Unfortunately, this scripture has made many " +
                "believers passionate for their “inheritance” from the " +
                "wicked. But there has been very little transfer and even " +
                "less impact made in the world of the unbeliever.\n" +
                "   It is not my intention to be critical of those who have " +
                "preached these messages for all these years. Nor am I " +
                "attempting to belittle those who have “confessed” their " +
                "promises.\n" +
                "   What I am saying is that there is a bigger reality that " +
                "truly works for those of us who want to be wealthy " +
                "stewards of the Kingdom of God. But the entrance to this " +
                "higher level must be through the gate of self denial and " +
                "the cross. Then we qualify to handle a transfer of wealth " +
                "from the heathen to the “just.” This is what is being " +
                "described in the Scripture as one who is righteous and " +
                "lives by faith.\n\n" +
                    "For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from " +
                    "faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by " +
                    "faith.\n\n" +
                "   The faith message is real, that God wants to bless His " +
                "children is true. The problem has always been the " +
                "“heart.” God loves all of us but, He only can trust those " +
                "who trust Him. Let’s look at a very interesting scripture " +
                "beginning in Luke 16:11.\n\n" +
                    "Therefore if you have not been faithful in the " +
                    "unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your " +
                    "trust the true riches? And if you have not been " +
                    "faithful in what is another man’s, who will give you " +
                    "what is your own? No servant can serve two " +
                    "masters; for either he will hate the one and love the " +
                    "other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise " +
                    "the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.\n\n" +
                "                                       —Luke 16:11-13\n\n" +
                "   Notice that Jesus makes it clear in the text that if we " +
                "can not be trusted with unrighteous Mammon, how can " +
                "we receive the true riches? The prosperity message has " +

                "strictly a test or way of measuring a true believer’s " +
                "heart.\n" +
                "   People who run after the wealth of this world " +
                "unfortunately have little understanding of how " +
                "abominable that is to our Lord.\n" +
                "   Some teachers of Scriptures and followers believe that " +
                "if you do not have lots of money, you have not achieved " +
                "the level of God that people with money have. Nothing " +
                "could be farther from the truth. God is interested in the " +
                "heart; always has and always will be. The heart is the " +
                "true compass of our motives.\n" +
                "   The rest of that Scripture tells us that you can not " +
                "serve two masters. Notice, Satan is not mentioned as a " +
                "master. So this other master must be a spirit to be " +
                "compared with God and it must desire worship in some " +
                "way.\n" +
                "In her book “Seated in Heavenly Places,” Ana Mendez " +
                "Ferrell talks about this subject in some detail:\n\n" +
                    "Mammon has a kingdom and a terribly strong " +
                    "structure with which he dominates the kingdoms of " +
                    "the earth and a vast majority of Christians. This " +
                    "spirit governs in a subtle way and is very difficult " +
                    "to detect by the people of God. Unfortunately, being " +
                    "ignorant of his devices is one of the principle causes " +
                    "that impede us from possessing what is ours.\n\n" +
                "   The book goes on to describe that the purpose of this " +
                "spirit called Mammon is to destroy our confidence in  " +
                "God and subtly cause us to submit to it. Mammon has a " +
                "voice. If we could identify it, the conversation might " +
                "sound like the following:\n\n" +
                    "I am your master; I control your finances, your " +
                    "emotions. I am the one who tells you what you can " +
                    "do and what you can’t do. I determine where you " +
                    "can travel, and if you can travel. I determine where " +
                    "you can buy your clothes, what restaurants you " +
                    "can go to and which ones you can’t. I am the one " +
                    "who says how you can treat the servants of God " +
                    "and what you can do and not do for them. I am the " +
                    "one who decides how much you can give for an " +
                    "offering and how much you can tithe, or even if you " +
                    "should tithe at all. I decide what school your " +
                    "children go to and to which hospital you can take " +
                    "your family. Remember, I am the one who makes " +
                    "your budget, and I determine what you can do and " +
                    "what you can’t, because I am your master. W hen " +
                    "you must make a decision concerning money, I am " +
                    "the first voice you hear. Oh, yeah, and that pain you " +
                    "get in your stomach over money, that’s me, and it is " +
                    "a result of the fear I have instilled in you.\n\n" +
                "   Is there any wonder why there has not been a transfer " +
                "of wealth? In all of our lives we have submitted to this " +
                "ruthless master called Mammon. Later in the book I am " +
                "going to spend time uncovering even further this spirit " +
                "so we can truly serve the only true God. I think it would " +
                "be good for all of us to renew our vow to our Lord Jesus " +
                "and repent for any attachment to Mammon.\n" +
                "   Let us pray this prayer before we precede further, " +
                "“Holy Father, we repent for being controlled by the " +
                "voice of Mammon. Please forgive us and lead us to a " +
                "deeper understanding of how our lives have been " +
                "controlled though this spirit of greed and anti-Christ. " +
                "Please restore us to your side and teach us to despise " +
                "Mammon.”\n" +
                "   This prayer is only a beginning of our fight to become " +
                "free from this demon. Our bondage to this devil did not " +
                "begin yesterday. We have been conditioned all our life to " +
                "trust in this filthy devil. It will require many battles and " +
                "total reliance on the Holy Spirit to become free.\n" +
                "   Continuing in Luke 16:14-15, we find some very " +
                "interesting comments by Jesus,\n\n" +
                    "Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also " +
                    "heard all these things, and they derided Him. And " +
                    "He said to them, “You are those who justify " +
                    "yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. " +
                    "For what is highly esteemed among men is an " +
                    "abomination in the sight of God.”\n\n" +
                "   Jesus revealed plainly the heart of the Pharisees. These " +
                "men tithed, gave offerings, were always in the " +
                "synagogues and were the spiritual leaders of their day. " +
                "These men were usually very wealthy, and Jesus made a " +
                "statement then that might well be relevant today, “You " +
                "justify yourselves before men.”\n" +
                "   As I mentioned earlier, some believe that material " +
                "wealth among “Christians” somehow validates ones " +
                "spiritual authority. I am not labeling all Christians who " +
                "have wealth as Pharisees. I am saying that the rest of " +
                "that Scripture is the bar by which we are all judged.\n" +
                "  The motive for giving is of primary concern for our " +
                "Lord and will be our determining factor as well. " +
                "Scripture is rich with examples of how we are to " +
                "prosper and not be in lack. That has not ever been " +
                "disputed, but the “why we give” should always be " +
                "judged.\n" +
                "   This is usually the first level of giving, and if those " +
                "who begin this way start to evaluate their motives and " +
                "let the Holy Spirit deal with them, we will move to the " +
                "next level of giving, which is giving out of obedience. \n\n" +
                "2. GIVING FROM OBEDIENCE\n\n" +
                "   This level of giving comes from listening to the voice of " +
                "the Holy Spirit and developing a trust and confidence in " +
                "Him. We have moved beyond trusting in Mammon and " +
                "have repented from listening to that hateful anti-Christ " +
                "voice. From this position of giving we start to " +
                "understand that all we have and all we will ever have " +
                "comes from our loving Father. He desires for us, His " +
                "children, to be trained in the higher ways of " +
                "stewardship. Therefore, He will test us in all levels of " +
                "obedience and all levels of giving.\n" +
                "   This type of giving is not to get, but to obey. Our true " +
                "motive is to please the heart of the Father. The obeying " +
                "in most cases is not easy, but we are learning to trust in " +
                "something other than ourselves.\n" +
                "   Once we enter this level of giving, the excitement of\n" +
                "the Father to have found someone who trusts Him can " +
                "be obvious. The Scripture in the beginning of Matthew " +
                "Six says He will reward those openly who give to Him " +
                "in secrete.\n" +
                "   In my life I have experienced many situations in " +
                "which my trust in God was tested. I can recall on one " +
                "occasion the Holy Spirit prompted me to give a large " +
                "sum of money to a ministry. The idea of giving several " +
                "thousands of dollars on a credit card did not make sense " +
                "to me. How many of us have learned that when the Lord " +
                "speaks to give, the mind is not the instrument for " +
                "arriving at a spiritual decision? We must simply obey " +
                "regardless of what the rational mind says.\n" +
                "   Fortunately, I overcame the voices of Mammon and " +
                "fear to give what I heard the Lord say. W ithin a matter " +
                "of hours after giving my offering, I was contacted by " +
                "someone I did not know, to purchase equipment I had " +
                "for sale. That sale more than made up for the offering.\n" +
                "   I experienced a satisfying feeling of joy for having " +
                "obeyed and a more exhilarating sensation for having " +
                "pleased the Father. But beyond the feelings I had the " +
                "sense that this act of obedience would produce a much " +
                "greater return than mere reaping for having sown.\n" +
                "   We have already spoken about one of the greatest acts " +
                "of obedience demonstrated by Abraham. This was " +
                "Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son. This level of " +
                "faith is not really understood today, although spoken " +
                "about very often. Indeed the messages of faith are truly " +
                "manifested in this example.\n" +
                "   But what of the everyday people like you and me who " +
                "have left everything at the altar to become true disciples " +
                "of our Lord?\n" +
                "   There are countless stories of precious saints who " +
                "have witnessed in the spirit our Lord’s suffering for " +
                "their right to become an heir of salvation. Men like John " +
                "G. Lake, who gave away his fortune to follow the call of " +
                "God on his life. We all will have a choice to make at " +
                "critical times in our lives. W ill we be able to obey " +
                "difficult instructions that in the visible realm seem " +
                "perilous? W ill we be able to walk in the supernatural " +
                "realm to forsake the seen for the unseen?\n" +
                "   Servants of God such as David, Joshua, Moses and " +
                "others understood this high level of obedience. But the " +
                "few of us “common folks” who have been instructed to " +
                "give all we hold dear in this world must learn to " +
                "consider what an honor and joy it is to be tested in this " +
                "way.\n" +
                "   This level of giving was tied to the observation made " +
                "by the author of Hebrews 12:2 when he said “looking " +
                "unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for " +
                "the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, " +
                "despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand " +
                "of the throne of God”\n" +
                "We see an example of this giving, found in 1 Kings " +
                "17:10-14.\n\n" +
                    "So Elijah went to Zarephath. W hen he reached the " +
                    "town gate, he saw a widow gathering wood for a " +
                    "fire. Elijah asked her, “W ould you bring me a little " +
                    "water in a cup so I may have a drink.” As she was " +
                    "going to get his water, Elijah said, “Please bring me " +
                    "a piece of bread, too.”\n" +
                    "The woman answered, “As surely as the Lord your " +
                    "God lives, I have no bread. I have only a handful of " +
                    "flour in a jar and only a little olive oil in a jug. I " +
                    "came here to gather some wood so I could go home " +
                    "and cook our last meal. My son and I will eat it and " +
                    "then die from hunger.”\n" +
                    "“Don’t worry,” Elijah said to her. “Go home and " +
                    "cook your food as you have said. But first make a " +
                    "small loaf of bread from the flour you have, and " +
                    "bring it to me. Then cook something for yourself and " +
                    "your son. The Lord, the God of Israel, says, ‘That jar " +
                    "of flour will never be empty, and the jug will " +
                    "always have oil in it, until the day the Lord sends " +
                    "rain to the land.’”\n\n" +

                " We know that God usually spoke exclusively through " +
                "His prophets in those days. And, until Peter received the " +
                "revelation of who Jesus was, not many others who " +
                "heard the voice of God were mentioned in the " +
                "Scriptures. However, in the following text we see " +
                "something extraordinary.\n\n" +
                    "Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “Go " +
                    "now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live " +
                    "there; for I have commanded a widow there to feed " +
                    "you.”\n\n" +
                "                                       —1 Kings 17:8-9\n\n" +
                "“God has commanded” is the part that stands out. I " +
                "often wondered why God would speak to a non-Jew " +
                "about providing food for His prophet. It occurred to me " +
                "that God always had future generations on His mind. If " +
                "He could not find Jewish people who would believe Him " +
                "then He would find someone outside the covenant. " +
                "Notice what Jesus said in the following scripture.\n\n" +
                    "Certainly there were many widows in Israel who " +

                    "any of the things he possessed was his own, but " +
                    "they had all things in common.\n\n" +

                    "But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira " +
                    "his wife, sold a possession. And he kept back part of " +
                    "the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and " +
                    "brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles’ " +
                    "feet. But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled " +
                    "your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back " +
                    "part of the price of the land for yourself? “W hile it " +
                    "remained, was it not your own? And after it was " +

                    "conceived this thing in your heart? You have not " +
                    "lied to men but to God.” Then Ananias, hearing " +
                    "these words, fell down and breathed his last. So " +
                    "great fear came upon all those who heard these " +
                    "things. And the young men arose and wrapped him " +
                    "up, carried him out, and buried him. Now it was " +
                    "about three hours later when his wife came in, not " +
                    "knowing what had happened. And Peter answered " +
                    "her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so " +
                    "much?” She said, “Yes, for so much.” Then Peter said " +
                    "to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to " +
                    "test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those " +
                    "who have buried your husband are at the door, and " +
                    "they will carry you out.” Then immediately she fell " +
                    "down at his feet and breathed her last. And the " +
                    "young men came in and found her dead, and " +
                    "carrying her out, buried her by her husband. So " +
                    "great fear came upon all the Church and upon all " +

                "   What would happen today if the Holy Ghost began to " +
                "expose the hearts of givers? W ould the term “slain in the " +

                "to achieve the place of real intimacy with our Savior. " +
                "Doors will open when we pass our tests of giving. Our " +
                "biggest door of resistance is when we refuse to look past " +
                "our circumstances and rely on what the natural eyes " +
                "can see. This only postpones the inevitable, the sacrifice " +
                "of our self. This will require an all consuming love of " +
                "commitment and realization of what has been " +
                "accomplished for us through the cross. The passion of " +
                "our Lord must consume each of us to take us to the next " +
                "level of giving until we ourselves become the gift on the " +

                "12.\n\n" +
                "LIVING SACRIFICE\n\n" +
                "We are going to take a journey, beginning in the Old " +
                "Testament with some examples of those who were " +
                "living sacrifices. We have already spoken about Isaac. " +
                "The interesting thing about Abraham’s offering of " +
                "obedience was that Isaac was just as obedient as his " +
                "father. Isaac was at least a teenager and probably strong " +
                "enough to have resisted if he had wanted. The fact that " +
                "he did not makes the obedience two-fold, the giver and " +
                "the gift. The analogy between Abraham and his son is " +
                "the foreshadowing of the greatest love ever shown, " +
                "Jesus, giving His life because of His love for His Father. " +
                "Now let us take a look at a living sacrifice who also " +
                "knew how to give-Job 1:1-5.\n\n" +
                    "There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name " +
                    "was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one " +
                    "who feared God and turned away from evil. There " +
                    "were born to him seven sons and three daughters. " +
                    "He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand " +
                    "camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred " +
                    "donkeys, and very many servants; so that this man " +
                    "was the greatest of all the people of the east. His " +
                    "sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s " +
                    "houses in turn; and they would send and invite " +
                    "their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And " +
                    "when the feast days had run their course, Job would " +
                    "send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in " +
                    "the morning and offer burnt offerings according to " +
                    "the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that " +
                    "my children have sinned, and cursed God in their " +
                    "hearts.\n" +
                "Most Bible historians agree that Job was perhaps, " +
                "after Genesis one of the oldest books in the Bible. This " +
                "means that long before Moses introduced the laws and " +
                "customs associated with Judaism, Job already knew " +
                "how to honor God with sacrifices. Job knew that hating " +
                "evil and fearing God was a principle to live by, and " +
                "doing it had always brought him riches and wisdom.\n " +
                "   We will discover some important things about " +
                "becoming a living sacrifice. The term sounds so holy and " +
                "lofty. Yet, the price to become a living sacrifice is self " +
                "evident. Job discovered that giving and being obedient " +
                "positioned him so God could use a mortal man to give " +
                "satan a foreshadow of his destiny.\n" +
                "   One day the heavenly beings came to present " +
                "themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came " +
                "among them to present himself before the Lord. The " +
                "Lord said to Satan, “W here have you come from?” " +
                "Satan answered the Lord, “From going to and fro on " +
                "the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” " +
                "The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my " +
                "servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a " +
                "blameless and upright man who fears God and " +
                "turns away from evil. He still persists in his " +
                "integrity, although you incited me against him, to " +
                "destroy him for no reason.” Then Satan answered " +
                "the Lord, “Skin for skin! All that people have they " +
                "will give to save their lives. But stretch out your " +
                "hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he " +
                "will curse you to your face.” The Lord said to Satan, " +
                "“Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.” " +
                "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, " +
                "and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of " +
                "his foot to the crown of his head. Job took a potsherd " +
                "with which to scrape himself, and sat among the " +
                "ashes.\n" +
                "Then his wife said to him, “Do you still persist in " +
                "your integrity? Curse God, and die.” But he said to " +
                "her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. " +
                "Shall we receive the good at the hand of God, and " +
                "not receive the bad?” In all this Job did not sin with " +
                "his lips.\n\n" +
                "                                          —Job 2:1-10\n\n" +
                "Satan actually believed that Job was like most of us " +
                "when threatened with losing our life, “skin for skin.” " +
                "This is where the tests of all tests begin in all of our lives.\n" +
                "   If we ever reach this place of a living sacrifice, we " +
                "must be prepared to become the bull on the altar and " +
                "hopefully a pleasing fragrance to the Father.\n" +
                "   The pain of losing everything, except a non-believing " +
                "wife and three miserable comforters, must have been " +
                "hell on earth for Job, yet despite all of this, the Bible says " +
                "“Job sinned not. ”\n" +
                "   One of the lessons we can all learn from the " +
                "experiences of Job is that all of us in our pursuit of God " +
                "will be tested. These tests will measure just how much " +
                "of our flesh and soul are in control of our decisions to " +
                "“give our life.”\n" +
                "   We discover later that the soul is fragmented between " +
                "the heart, mind and emotions. Giving tests the mind and " +
                "heart of man. These areas were fragmented at the fall of " +
                "Adam. Hebrews 4:12 talks about the word of God being " +
                "sharp and powerful . . . “His word can cut through our " +
                "spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow, " +
                "until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our " +
                "hearts.”\n" +
                "   Man is the only creature whose thoughts can differ " +
                "from his intentions or motives. Jesus knew the heart of " +
                "man and understood how to test the motives. Giving is " +
                "the one key that must unite motives and thoughts for " +
                "our relationship to deepen.\n" +
                "   If our giving is corrupted by “what is in it for me?” " +
                "attitudes, then we will never progress. If we want to " +
                "pass the level of “giving to get” and move into the level " +
                "of “giving out of obedience,” then we must be sensitive " +
                "to the precious Holy Spirit and His methods of testing. " +
                "Job did not know the way of the cross and yet he was " +
                "willing through faith to trust God and retain his " +
                "integrity. Job was a living sacrifice that produced such " +
                "an aroma in the nostrils of God that Satan was shamed " +
                "by a mortal man.\n" +
                "   The pain of losing everything was bad enough, but the " +
                "continual torment of the miserable comforters was and " +
                "is today just like Satan. W hat joy the Father received " +
                "when Job prayed for his tormenters after his trial. This " +
                "would be like kicking the bruise already visible on the " +
                "head of Satan.\n" +
                "   Job’s name is mentioned in Ezekiel 14:13-14 as one of " +
                "three righteous men. The word of the Lord came again to " +
                "me, saying: “Son of man, when a land sins against Me by " +
                "persistent unfaithfulness, I will stretch out My hand " +
                "against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send famine " +
                "on it, and cut off man and beast from it. “Even if these " +
                "three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would " +
                "deliver only themselves by their righteousness,” says " +
                "the Lord God.\n" +
                "   This speaks volumes of how pleased God was with " +
                "this man’s living sacrifice. Job was still on God’s mind, " +
                "long after he had died. This gift of Job’s was counted as " +
                "righteous. We all will have this opportunity to present " +
                "our selves before the Lord as a living sacrifice. " +
                "The next example of a living sacrifice is found in " +
                "Romans 12. We will describe in some detail what this " +
                "phrase means:\n\n" +
                    "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of " +
                    "God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, " +
                    "holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable " +
                    "service. And do not be conformed to this world, but " +
                    "be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that " +
                    "you may prove what is that good and acceptable " +
                    "and perfect will of God.\n\n" +
                "   The man who pinned that scripture knew something " +
                "about becoming a living sacrifice. Paul had been a zealot " +
                "for years before being introduced to the One he was " +
                "persecuting on the road to Damascus.\n" +
                "   Paul known as Saul was the tormentor used by Satan " +
                "to harass and kill early believers. Saul believed it was " +
                "his duty as a good Pharisee to uphold the Levitical Law " +
                "of Moses and destroy all those who were followers of " +
                "this blasphemer called Jesus. However, Jesus was able to " +
                "transform the executioner into the deliverer. This " +
                "transformation took place as a result of the death of Saul " +
                "and the resurrection of Paul.\n" +
                "   This can happen to us when we place our self on the " +
                "altar. W hat is tied to the altar is not what rises from the " +
                "altar.\n" +
                "   But even though the spiritual transformation took " +
                "place on the road to Damascus, I believe something even " +
                "more dramatic happened in the spirit realm at " +

                "him out of the city and began to stone him; and the " +
                "witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man " +
                "named Saul. W hile they were stoning Stephen, he " +
                "prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he " +
                "knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do " +
                "not hold this sin against them.” W hen he had said " +

                "   When we have reached this point in our Christian " +
                "giving, we have come to the altar of God, where " +
                "obedience now changes to understanding. This is the " +
                "purest form of giving. This is the example God’s only son " +
                "set. This must be the goal for the Church, whose purpose " +

                "to be concerned about the principal of sowing and " +
                "reaping. This is when we come to understand “giving is " +

                "   This is the condition where one lives by faith. This is " +

                "the life we presently understand is like looking through " +
                "a dirty window. We can not see the complete picture or " +
                "correct image. So what we see is incomplete; it has " +
                "missing information that is critical for our " +

                "happens to a computer, when the wrong data is entered; " +

                "   If unchanged minds try to understand the Spirit, " +
                "inevitably we will have the wrong perception of Him " +
                "and this results in bad decisions and frustrated lives. " +
                "However, if we go to the altar with everything we have, " +
                "not just in money but our lives, then something is " +
                "altered in our minds. That something will eventually " +

                "breed of believers who move past the “giving to get” " +

                "begin with in prayer must be changed. This takes time " +

                "There are several levels and positions of prayer:\n\n" +

                "   This type of praying is typical of the Christians who " +
                "have not gone through the process of receiving the key of " +
                "giving. These believers have not gone to the altar of self " +
                "denial and thus do not know how to pray.\n" +
                "   Prayers from the untransformed mind have liTTle to " +
                "no impact in the spirit realm. We have already learned " +
                "that faith does not reside in the mind. This could be why " +
                "the Holy Spirit is not received or understood by the " +
                "majority of the people on the planet.\n" +
                "   We are all trained to memorize, categorize and " +
                "process through the mind and in order to make " +
                "decisions. We are taught this procedure in most schools " +
                "of elementary and secondary education. This training is " +
                "considered to be the most important part of our " +
                "development. The time and energy spent in developing " +

                "  The real tragedy is that so few are aware of the spirit " +
                "realm and even fewer know how to access it. Those who " +
                "have understanding are usually not the Christians. It " +
                "has been our experience that only small parts of the " +
                "leadership are themselves capable of “moving in the " +

                "   Moreover, we find that those who have knowledge of " +

                "   The prayers of the mind are those that do not " +
                "originate from the Holy Spirit, but in the carnal souls of " +
                "people.\n" +
                "   These prayers create in the Christian a sense of well " +
                "being. This is because man has always wanted religion " +
                "to tell him how to act, what to do, what rules he must " +
                "follow, etcetera. Religion takes the place of God and " +
                "leaves man defenseless when it comes to dealing with " +
                "devils and demonic influences.\n" +
                "   We have to understand that prayer begins by living " +
                "our lives in a particular way. Jesus explained this to His " +
                "disciples, illustrating several important points. First " +
                "and foremost Jesus said no man can be His disciple " +
                "unless he is willing to leave everything.\n\n" +
                    "Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and " +
                    "mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, " +
                    "and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever " +
                    "does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be " +
                    "my disciple.\n\n" +
                "                                           —Luke 14:26-27\n\n" +
                "   Comprehending this principle comes from the place of " +
                "realizing your life is no longer your own. This should " +
                "eliminate immediately of praying from our mind.\n" +
                "  The one who prays from the mind is the one who " +
                "thinks his prayers are heard from his much speaking. " +
                "The mind is full of noise, primarily because it is the " +
                "center of voices.\n" +
                "   These voices are from the “master” we have chosen to " +
                "listen to. In an earlier chapter we spoke about the voice " +
                "of Mammon. Every voice other than the Holy Spirit is " +
                "designed by the enemy to create fear and doubt.\n" +
                "   So prayers coming from the mind that has not been " +
                "reformed into the image of Christ will pray selfish and " +
                "frightened prayers The reason for this is because the one " +
                "praying is convinced by the enemy that his or her needs " +
                "must be met for their well being to be maintained. The " +
                "motive behind these prayers is fear, not faith. The mind, " +
                "because of its very fallen nature, must believe that it is " +
                "secure and protected in order to function properly.\n" +
                "   It is easy to see why these prayers have no effect and " +
                "rather produce false images of our Father. We have " +
                "spoken earlier about the need for a new or transformed " +
                "mind. This will be a theme through our study.\n" +
                "   The unregenerate mind will lose every battle against " +
                "the devil. There is no amount of praying of this kind that " +
                "will protect you or will reveal information from the " +
                "Father by the Holy Spirit. In fact, the natural mind will " +
                "not allow you to understand the Bible at all. The Bible is " +
                "written by the Spirit and which by necessity causes it " +
                "only to be realized through our spirits.\n" +
                "   Therefore, if our prayer life is empty and tedious, we " +
                "would do well to follow the pattern set by Jesus. That " +
                "pattern is to follow the Spirit. The Spirit will teach us " +
                "how to give out of obedience before showing us how to " +
                "pray.\n" +
                "   Then let the Holy Ghost take us beyond “what we can " +
                "even believe or understand.” Then He will open a door of " +
                "praying like we have never had before. Step by step each " +
                "of us can increase our faith. Then we will not only " +
                "increase our faith but rely totally upon the Holy Spirit " +
                "for our “daily bread.”\n" +
                "   When we have entered through the door of prayer " +
                "opened by the key of giving, we immediately begin to " +
                "move past the mind and start to pray directly from our " +
                "spirit.\n\n" +
                "PRAYING FROM THE SPIRIT\n" +
                "   This type of praying is recognizable by the evidence of " +
                "many things, not the least of which is receiving answers " +
                "to our prayers. Prayer becomes one of the most valuable " +
                "substances of your daily life; because you are becoming " +
                "one mind with the most awesome praying Spirit-the " +
                "Holy Spirit.\n" +
                "   “GIVE us this day our daily bread,” this is an example " +
                "that we must be a giver in order to ask to be given. And " +
                "then notice how the food is wrapped in every day’s " +
                "revelation, which is our daily bread. Each day becomes " +
                "food for our spirit because the Holy Spirit has plans for " +
                "that day from before the foundation of the world, and to " +
                "discover this becomes our sustenance.\n" +
                "   We have already become a “living sacrifice” upon the " +
                "altar of our God. We have developed that level of trust " +
                "to believe our heavenly Father will take care of OUR " +
                "every need, but what about His needs.\n" +
                "   The Father is longing for children who will mature so " +
                "that He can trust them as stewards of His Kingdom. This " +
                "requires children who are willing to hear His spirit and " +
                "begin to share in the obligations of a steward. Stewards " +
                "must understand their duties. This is only possible by " +
                "praying in and from the Spirit.\n\n" +
                    "For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep " +
                    "things of God. For what man knows the things of a " +
                    "man except the spirit of the man which is in him? " +
                    "Even so no one knows the things of God except the " +
                    "Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit " +
                    "of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that " +
                    "we might know the things that have been freely " +
                    "given to us by God. These things we also speak, not " +
                    "in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which " +
                    "the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things " +
                    "with spiritual. But the natural man does not receive " +
                    "the things of the Spirit of God, for they are " +
                    "foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because " +
                    "they are spiritually discerned.\n\n" +
                    "                           —1 Corinthians 2:10-14\n\n" +
                "   Prayer is no longer our voice emanating from the " +
                "fallen condition of our mind but the Spirit of God " +
                "communicating with our spirit in a glorious exchange " +
                "orchestrated from heaven and demonstrated on earth " +
                "through a vessel yielded to the ways of the Spirit. This " +
                "beautiful condition is where our duties as steward " +
                "become realized. As we hear the Father’s heart, our " +
                "spirit is united to His in such compassion and faith that " +
                "our very existence is altered.\n" +
                "   When we find our self in this heavenly cooperation, " +
                "our needs, such as food, shelter, money etc. become " +
                "unimportant. After all, we are now participating with " +
                "the Spirit of God in establishing His kingdom on earth. " +
                "His Kingdom dominates every material substance in the " +
                "universe. This is what Jesus demonstrated every time " +
                "He changed water to wine or fed the multitudes or " +
                "commanded a fish to swallow a gold coin.\n" +
                "   These prayers are kingdom prayers designed to " +
                "establish agreement for something much higher than " +
                "our needs and wants.\n\n" +
                    "For we do not know what we should pray for as we " +
                    "ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for " +
                    "us with groaning which cannot be uttered. Now He " +
                    "who searches the hearts knows what the mind of " +
                    "the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the " +
                    "saints according to the will of God.\n\n" +
                    "                                   —Romans 8:26-27\n\n" +
                "   This passage from the Bible is generally quoted when " +
                "someone is speaking about persons praying in unknown " +
                "tongues. But have we ever considered that our precious " +
                "Holy Spirit is so grieved by our conditions of “darkness” " +
                "that He has no words to express His feelings to the " +
                "Father? W hen we join our spirits with His, we too, have " +
                "no earthly words that can express our conditions.\n" +
                "   This position of prayer is from and in the Spirit. This " +
                "is not a place in our minds and emotions.\n" +
                "  God is a God of order and design and requires true " +
                "Christians disciplined to join Him in prayers that " +
                "unlock the destinies of peoples and countries. Praying " +
                "this way in the spirit demands such high level " +
                "obedience and perseverance that without the key of " +
                "giving one does not have the capacity to enter and " +
                "believe for what the Holy Spirit will reveal.\n" +
                "   This not only requires praying in the spirit, but faith " +
                "at the level of the Holy Spirit. That faith comes by " +
                "hearing and hearing by the W ord of God is a fact, but " +
                "the truth of that verse becomes reality in this place of " +
                "prayer.\n" +
                "   Why? Because you will hear the Spirit of God and " +
                "what you hear you believe and begin to speak. (Romans " +
                "10: 9-10) This creates the faith of God, through the " +
                "Rhema word being heard and repeated. This is also the " +
                "effectual prayer of the righteous man spoken of in James " +
                "chapter 4.\n" +
                "   Prayer must be an exchange of what is happening in " +
                "Heaven with what is going on in the earth. If this does " +
                "not take place, true prayer has not been experienced. " +
                "Every thing that happens from the spirit realm is " +
                "looking for an avenue to be manifested in the natural.\n" +
                "   When Jesus said “I only do what I see my Father do,” " +
                "that was not something said to merely fill the pages of " +
                "the Bible. This was a teaching to show us how to pray. " +
                "Everything we need and everything the Father wants to " +
                "manifest has already been done. Prayer is not just " +
                "communication but demonstration.\n\n" +
                    "Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, the Son " +
                    "can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees " +
                    "the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, the " +
                    "Son does likewise. The Father loves the Son and " +
                    "shows him all that he himself is doing; and he will " +
                    "show him greater works than these, so that you " +
                    "will be astonished. Indeed, just as the Father raises " +
                    "the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives " +
                    "life to whomever he wishes.”\n\n" +
                    "                                               —John 5:19-21\n\n" +
                "   This statement was intended to show us that as we " +
                "actually unite with the Holy Spirit we lose all of our " +
                "own identity and become one voice. That voice has no " +
                "fears, doubts, or unbelief. That voice calls things from " +
                "heaven to earth and sees the end from the beginning. " +
                "This is the voice that said “let there be light” and there " +
                "was and it was good. Prayer has become the language of " +
                "heaven. Let that sink deep into our spirit.\n" +
                "   We are dealing with powers so great that our earthly " +
                "bodies and minds are unable to comprehend the " +
                "magnitude. That is why it requires the training Jesus is " +
                "describing through Matthew 6.\n\n" +
                "BECOMING THE PRAYER\n" +
                "   The prayer above is an example in which Jesus did " +
                "only what he saw the Father doing is a wonderful " +
                "revelation of the level of prayer that changes things in " +
                "the natural realm.\n" +
                "  But you might say, that was Jesus, how can we see the " +
                "Father? Jesus was trained by the Holy Spirit to enter " +
                "such intimacy with the Father that seeing the spirit " +
                "realm and watching His Father was His everyday life. " +
                "That reproduced on earth what He saw in Heaven and " +
                "was as natural to Him as breathing.\n" +
                "   Praying at this level is not something anyone can " +
                "understand without first becoming the gift and going " +
                "through the “fire” Jesus wraps His people in.\n\n" +
                    "John said, “I am just baptizing with water. But " +
                    "someone more powerful is going to come, and I am " +
                    "not good enough even to untie his sandals. He will " +
                    "baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.”\n\n " +

                "   We spoke earlier about praying in the “spirit,” but " +
                "“becoming the prayer” is a level beyond. We must " +
                "become the fire from the altar of heaven. This is " +
                "something very powerful! Let’s consider it for a " +
                "moment.\n" +
                "   We began our prayer life by uniting with the Spirit of " +
                "God. Gradually we began to see that the more the Holy " +
                "Spirit controls our life the more fire burns within our " +
                "spirits. The more the fire burns within us the less " +
                "“chaff” remains. The fire becomes so intense that we are " +
                "consumed and become the incense mentioned in " +

                    "from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, " +
                    "and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your " +
                    "iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.”\n\n" +
                    "                                               —Isaiah 6:6-7\n\n" +
                "   When we become the “prayer” we are truly " +
                "unrecognizable to ourselves. The Father, whose heart " +
                "has always been to bring back His children, begins to " +
                "pray through us. This manifests beyond groans into " +
                "spiritual fire on the altar of God. This fire as it burns " +
                "away our sins and iniquities becomes incense. The smell " +
                "coincides with the amount of soul and flesh being " +
                "burned. As we surrender more and more of our selves " +
                "the aroma changes.\n" +
                "   Finally, when there is only our renewed mind and " +
                "soul on the altar the fragrance smells heavenly. This is " +

                "  Many great men of God attained this level of " +

                    "criminals, one on the right hand and the other on " +
                    "the left. Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for " +

                "   This prayer can only be prayed when we are full of " +
                "the Holy Ghost. This prayer is the standard by which all " +
                "other prayers must be judged. It’s the sweet aroma, " +
                "which is God himself manifesting in the sacrificial fire. " +
                "Prayer of this kind becomes like the spirit. It moves " +

                "   Here we see the key to becoming the prayer. Jesus " +

                "  Let me explain it another way. Our souls are like an " +
                "Old Testament altar, to which the sacrifices were " +
                "brought by the high priests. The sacrifices are our " +
                "thoughts; our habits, our imaginations, our images, our " +
                "desires and dreams. W hen these are brought to the altar " +
                "of our soul and burned, the fragrances, sounds, and " +
                "sights that are emitted show the quality and quantity of " +
                "our sacrifice.\n" +
                "   This can reveal our level of giving and praying. If the " +
                "aroma is sweet and the fire all – consuming, then " +
                "whatever we ask the Father in Jesus’ name will be done. " +
                "The Father knows through the fragrance of our prayers, " +
                "if they come from a vessel filled with the essence of His " +
                "son.\n" +
                "The Father saw and heard the agony of His son in " +
                "Gethsemane. The sight of blood coming from the pores " +
                "in his body emitted an odor like no other. His odor was " +
                "more than a body and soul dying. That odor came from " +
                "a life of total surrender and total victory.\n" +
                "   The prayer: from Gethsemane flowed from the heart " +
                "of His Father who had already crowned Him above " +
                "everything in heaven and on earth. Those are the " +
                "prayers that the disciples learned about after the death " +
                "and resurrection of Jesus. They learned those prayers in " +
                "their own Gethsemane.\n" +
                "   Gethsemane will be where each of us will learn as " +
                "well. W hen Jesus said “take up your cross and follow " +
                "me,” he was speaking about going through “the garden” " +
                "to pick up our own cross.\n" +
                "  These prayers are not something most Bible schools\n" +
                "teach, or can they be learned from theories. These type of " +
                "prayers come from the spirit of God through vessels " +
                "emptied of themselves and not concerned with self " +
                "preservation. We all must evaluate our life and where " +
                "we are in the development of our prayer life. Then " +
                "decide where we would like to be and how to arrive. " +

                "   I can remember one day not long ago when something " +
                "extraordinary happened to me and my wife. We were in " +
                "our prayer room early one morning, which is our " +
                "practice when we are at home. Our prayer room is one " +
                "of the nicest rooms in our home. In fact we decided to " +
                "make our dining room the ministry office so we could " +
                "turn one of the bedrooms into our prayer room. This has " +
                "become one of the most precious places in our home.\n" +
                "   One morning as we entered into the room and sat " +
                "down to worship the absolute Glory of God descended. " +
                "The weight of His Glory was so intense we could not " +
                "move. We were caught up into this ecstasy every " +
                "morning for almost a month. During these days, we " +
                "would talk to Him and ask Him things, but He never " +
                "responded.\n" +
                "   We were somewhat concerned because so often " +
                "during our worship the Lord reveals powerful life-changing " +
                "truths for our lives. So, being human, we were " +
                "wondering if we had offended our sweet Holy Spirit. But " +
                "that did not seem to be the case, since His presence was " +
                "so strong in that room. Finally, the Lord began to reveal " +
                "to us that He was not angry or offended with us. But in " +
                "fact, He had found a place where He could come and feel " +
                "the Love and Peace He, Himself was bringing. He had " +
                "just wanted to come and Rest. We were speechless and " +
                "so honored to have provided a place for the King of " +
                "Glory to rest His Head. Alleluia!\n" +
                "   It is the Holy Spirit’s desire that we all begin to " +
                "understand the journey which lies beyond us. I believe " +
                "Jesus gave us valuable keys to unlock doors that hold " +
                "these mysteries and so much more.\n" +
                "  I know that giving unlocks the door so we might learn " +
                "how to pray. Then, through His grace we can move step " +
                "by step to discover what was hidden. The process of " +
                "prayer development is in direct proportion to our " +
                "process of self-denial.\n" +
                "   There is nothing more critical for us to understand " +
                "than that what and where we are now is a direct result " +
                "of whom we are serving. This is expressed in every " +
                "aspect of our life, but most profoundly in our giving and " +
                "praying. Our location in Christian maturity does not " +
                "depend solely on Jesus or the Holy Spirit, but our choices " +
                "as well.\n" +
                "   We made the choices and paid the price to arrive " +
                "where we are now. Now we must pay the price to leave " +
                "where we are at present, in order to seize the prize that " +
                "is set before us.\n" +
                "   The price we must pay to get that prize is not as great " +
                "as the reward or nearly as costly as the alternative. " +
                "Choosing our own ways, or the good ideas of this " +
                "world is much more costly than we think, with no " +
                "eternal fruit at the end. We all must come to the " +
                "realization on this journey that there is no escape from " +
                "this life alive.\n" +
                "   Many people live their lives, as if there was not death " +
                "at the end of this natural existence. They prefer to live in " +
                "a fantasy world, in which they go through life in " +
                "absolute denial. Most choose not to even think of an end " +
                "to a life filled with “their make-believe existence.” " +
                "However, not thinking about it will not make it less a " +

                "   There is a spirit realm that dominates the natural. The " +
                "sooner we qualify for authority in that kingdom the " +
                "better. We can either be co-dominators with the Holy " +
                "Spirit in that realm or be dominated by the devil and " +
                "our unreformed minds and hearts.\n" +
                "   The qualification is measured, at first, by the level of " +

                "determined by the keys we acquire and the doors we " +
                "enter. God will never force man to do anything he does " +
                "not choose.\n" +
                "   I know there are more than three levels in any topic " +
                "Jesus discussed in Matthew 6. I have observed that just " +
                "as giving transforms the mind and heart, praying " +
                "intensifies that work and in addition begins to reform " +
                "the soul.\n" +
                "  In order for our soul to be totally reformed, the flesh " +
                "must be dominated by the Spirit.\n" +

                "prayer, we begin to realize that our flesh must undergo " +
                "the transformation process released through fasting.\n" +
                "   So an additional key is given to our understanding as " +
                "a result of our prayer life. That key unlocks a door that " +
                "has not only been locked but difficult to even approach " +
                "for most Christians, and that is fasting.\n" +

                "society.\n" +
                "   The Church has lost power to appeal to the world " +
                "because it offers little if any real spiritual values, not " +
                "because of what is said, but because of what is done.\n" +
                "   So, in order to attract people, some churches resort to " +
                "the system the world uses-entertainment, " +
                "advertisement, “user friendly” environments, so not to " +
                "offend visitors. These Church leaders want to offer " +
                "programs and environments that make the “lost” or " +
                "heathen feel accepted. This sounds appealing on the " +
                "surface, but like everything else that comes from the " +
                "“world system,” it is false.\n" +
                "   Remember when Satan told Jesus “If you would " +
                "worship me, I would give you all the kingdoms of this " +
                "world.” He was offering Him, not only the nations but " +
                "“The world’s ruling system.” I believe we can make the " +
                "same analogy today. W hat he is now saying is: “If you " +
                "worship me, following my world system, I will give you " +
                "the multitudes. “It is not just about gathering crowds, " +
                "but taking them to a real encounter with the Lord, that " +
                "will turn them from sin and flesh which is “the world " +
                "system, to the Kingdom of God.\n" +
                "  One of the famous statements of the world is “The end " +
                "justifies the means.” This is far from being godly. The " +
                "Father does care a lot about the means. Because worldly " +
                "appealing, non-confronting, non-transforming methods " +
                "can never lead to holy, righteous living.\n" +
                "   I think every pastor would agree if you want to " +
                "attract crowds you must invite Jesus as King and Lord " +
                "first and allow Him to direct the activities. The " +
                "transformation must begin within our minds and " +
                "hearts as the blueprints the Master designed.\n" +
                "   If we don’t give, we can’t expect to learn how to pray " +
                "effectively. All this is so basic and yet so difficult for the " +
                "Church to embrace.\n" +
                "  The reason we are talking about this in our section of " +
                "fasting is that most Churches are in a condition in " +
                "which fasting would change their atmosphere " +
                "dramatically. The pastors would not be spending night " +
                "and day counseling their sheep. Instead, they would " +
                "have more time to be with the Lord. But because many " +
                "Church leaders, who themselves have never progressed " +
                "from giving and praying cannot possibly understand " +
                "fasting.\n" +
                "   Fasting would bring the flesh under total subjection " +
                "and the Churches today need this desperately. But there " +
                "is a sequence and order in God.\n" +
                "   When He showed Moses the tabernacle, He did so " +
                "from the inside out. The design was first “The Holy of " +
                "Holies,” then “The Holy place,” then “The Inner Court " +
                "and then “The Outer Court.” This is also the method " +
                "God uses to change us, from the inside out.\n" +
                "   Therefore, once our hearts and minds are " +
                "transformed, we can begin with the flesh in our bodies. " +
                "That is why fasting is sequenced the way it is in " +
                "Matthew 6.\n" +
                "   We are talking about fasting in this chapter, so to " +
                "understand that in order to fast we must enter in " +
                "through the proper door.\n" +
                "   Remember what Jesus said in John 10? He was saying " +
                "that those who try to gather the sheep by any means " +
                "other than by Him are thieves and robbers. He said later " +
                "in that chapter that He is the door by which sheep enter.\n" +
                "   All of our programs and systems that have been " +
                "devised by means other than God’s ways are like the " +
                "illustration above and will create problems, not " +
                "solutions.\n" +
                "   If we call for a forty day fast and pastor a Church that " +
                "has less than 10% who tithe, what is the likelihood the " +
                "fast will be successful? The same is true when we have " +
                "all night prayer meetings or anything else requiring our " +
                "hearts and mind to be controlled by the Holy Spirit.\n" +
                "   We all know Jesus said to “love God with all our " +
                "heart.” Mark 12:30:\n\n" +
                    "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your " +
                    "heart, with all your soul, with your entire mind, " +
                    "and with all your strength.\n\n" +
                "   So how can we possibly love God with all our heart, " +
                "soul, and mind when we don’t give or pray and much " +
                "less fast? We have no understanding of the power " +
                "required for that passage to be fulfilled.\n" +
                "   This is the purpose of the revelations that the Holy " +
                "Spirit is pouring out on earth in these last days. He " +
                "knows the Church is in great turmoil. He knows we " +
                "desperately need an “upper room” experience. So He is " +
                "giving us keys to unlock life-changing, world shaking " +
                "revelations that will expose and destroy this world’s " +
                "system.\n" +
                "   Remember, revelation sometimes requires " +
                "demonstration to become an impartation. In other " +
                "words, we must use our physical bodies to perform an " +
                "act associated with the revelation.\n" +
                "   For example, Noah built an ark, Abraham was willing " +
                "to sacrifice his son and Joshua marched around Jericho. " +
                "These acts caused the revelation to become one with " +
                "their spirit, and opened doors for the spirit realm and " +
                "natural realm to interface. This is why our reformed " +
                "hearts and minds require a physically submitted body. " +
                "Our physical acts manifest the passion generated in our " +
                "reformed souls by fasting.\n" +
                "   A body can be used by God as a channel between the " +
                "invisible and the natural realms. Daniel’s diet and his " +
                "fasting lifestyle contributed to the clear and powerful " +
                "revelations that he experienced. The same is true with " +
                "Elijah and John the Baptist. Our fasting results in " +
                "impartations of revelation from the precious Holy Spirit.\n" +
                "   When through our giving and praying we have " +
                "demonstrated an understanding of trust and " +
                "submission to the Father, then we are permitted access " +
                "to a heavenly power that can deliver nations.\n" +
                "  Jesus said in Matthew 17:14 and Mark 9:29, when " +
                "speaking about delivering a boy, whom His disciples " +
                "could not deliver, “This kind does not come out unless " +
                "one has prayed and fasted.”\n" +
                "   Jesus was demonstrating and declaring the order of " +
                "power for “kingdom manifestations.” Prayer as we have " +
                "discussed opens the door to fasting. Jesus followed the " +
                "dynamics because He followed His Father’s order. This " +
                "divine pattern positioned Jesus in awesome places of " +
                "authority for major deliverance.\n" +
                "   That boy was not delivered because Jesus spoke, but " +
                "it was from the position where Jesus spoke. If we can " +
                "see the design of God we can see the weakness of our " +
                "enemy. The design outlined by Jesus in Matthew 6 is " +
                "our road map to reformation and keys to operate in " +
                "kingdom authority.\n" +
                "   Transformation is the one essential ingredient that " +
                "has been missing for us to live in the spirit as Paul " +
                "described in Romans 8. This ingredient will take us back " +
                "to the cross where our bodies must hang.\n" +
                "   Fasting makes this a reality. If our bodies are on the " +
                "cross our perspective and opinions change. “The spirit is " +
                "willing but the flesh is weak,” will not be heard from the " +
                "cross. The place of power and transformation can be " +
                "realized only from that position.\n" +
                "   If only the Church will find that message again, the " +
                "need for “programs” to attract crowds will diminish. " +
                "Fasting is the single greatest weapon in the hands of the " +
                "Christian that will cause hell to tremble and devils to " +
                "flee.\n" +
                "  If our Christian life is powerless and unsatisfying, it is " +
                "because we have not allowed ourselves exposure to the " +
                "spirit realm through the cross of His majesty. It is for " +
                "such people that I want to say the following:\n" +
                "   God has given everything to enable us to discover the " +
                "wonders of His ways. He will not try to entertain you " +
                "with tricks and gimmicks for your amusements and " +
                "“lukewarm” attitudes. If you have ears to hear and eyes " +
                "to see, He will transform your mediocrity into a life " +
                "beyond what you or Hollywood could imagine.\n" +
                "   I reached that point in my Christian life in which I " +
                "made a choice to find God or die trying. I had my fill of " +
                "the parlor tricks of the new age and the pseudo " +
                "“Christian” life. I say pseudo because it had all the right " +
                "languages and “acts” of power Christian living without " +
                "any of the lasting fruit.\n" +
                "   So I began to study the Scriptures with prayer and " +
                "fasting. I accidentally discovered the design of God " +
                "revealed in Matthew 6. The following was how I " +
                "attempted to fast in the beginning. It also demonstrates " +
                "the mercy of our God.\n" +
                "   My experience with fasting began several years ago, " +
                "even before I began to understand the process outlined " +
                "in Matthew. I began to fast to eliminate toxins from my " +
                "body. I had read that it was a good thing for the body to " +
                "cleanse itself from the inside out. So I determined to " +
                "begin a three day fast on liquids. My experience was " +
                "probably very normal. I watched the clock and could " +
                "not believe there were only 24 hours in a day. The three " +
                "days finally ended and I had accomplished a measure of " +
                "the detoxification that I had sought. But during those " +
                "three days the Holy Spirit began to speak to me about " +
                "some things in my life. He began to tell me that I was a " +
                "slave to my mind and body and that He had not created " +
                "me to live that way. He went on to describe how He " +
                "would transform my thought process if I would submit " +
                "to Him.\n" +
                "   I had been praying the prayer in Ephesians 1:17-20 " +
                "about having the spirit of wisdom and the eyes of my " +
                "understanding opened. So I eagerly submitted.\n" +
                "   The next morning He awoke me with a determination " +
                "to fast like never before. I believed for seven days. I did " +
                "not begin that day but planned to start the following " +
                "week. Those of you who have scheduled something from " +
                "God to begin at a certain date know the tactics of the " +
                "enemy. Everything that could go wrong did. Machinery " +
                "broke, my son misbehaved and I got sick. Nevertheless, I " +
                "was determined to keep my appointment with the Holy " +
                "Ghost.\n" +
                "   My mind was busy sending all kinds of fear messages " +
                "to my body. My body was reacting by sneezing, " +
                "coughing and complaining. But, I remained resolute to " +
                "break the chains of slavery over my life, and I began the " +
                "seven day fast.\n" +
                "   By the end of the third day my body was not hungry. " +
                "By the fourth day I was feeling fresh and alive. I began to " +
                "pray with a new energy and faith. W hen the fifth day " +
                "arrived my spirit was receiving information from the " +
                "Holy Spirit on Scriptures I had read and not understood " +
                "for years.\n" +
                "   As the days went on His presence grew until I began " +
                "to weep uncontrollably. I was in the presence of the One " +
                "my heart was seeking. I had felt His presence before, on a " +
                "number of occasions. But this was different. It was as if " +
                "He had decided to bring such a level of glory into my " +
                "room that all I could do was see my wretchedness. The " +
                "light and glory was so overwhelming that at times I " +
                "could not rise off the floor.\n" +
                "   I began to worship and express my grateful heart any " +
                "way I could. I did not want to lose this indescribable " +
                "feeling. During this time I was changing into something I " +
                "did not know or understand. My desire to please the " +
                "Father increased beyond my need to be blessed. I always " +
                "had wanted to please Him but my thoughts and " +
                "emotions had contaminated those efforts. I could not see " +
                "Him in the absolute splendor of His majesty. The images " +
                "created from my mind and heart had perverted His " +
                "Holiness and Glory.\n" +
                "   Suddenly, I could see the condition of my soul and " +
                "body. I saw the chains of fear, sin and iniquity in my life. " +
                "I began to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit directing me " +
                "through worship on how to destroy those strongholds. " +
                "As I began to shout and dance before the Lord, angels " +
                "began to enter the room with swords like I had never " +
                "seen before. They cut away a lot of the chains. Some of " +
                "the things they did I had no understanding of then or " +
                "even to this day. All I know is that the level of ecstasy I " +
                "was experiencing was beyond description.\n" +
                "   For some incredible reason, fasting had broken a hole " +
                "in the barrier created by my wrong thoughts and " +
                "images. It was like I saw for the first time images coming " +
                "from heaven instead of my poisoned mind. The " +
                "overwhelming sensations I experienced can not be done " +
                "justice by words. Suffice it to say that the " +
                "multidimensional facets of His majesty left me helpless " +
                "to express anything but uncontrollable crying and joy.\n" +
                "   My life was forever altered in that instant. In His " +
                "mercy He opened the spirit realm for me to see. He began " +
                "to tell me that fasting is a weapon the Church has " +
                "avoided because of the lies of the enemy. He said He is " +
                "going to use people like me to restore what had been " +
                "stolen.\n" +
                "   Since that time I have been on several fasts at the " +
                "Lord’s direction, some times over two hundred days in a " +
                "year. The first forty day fast was a landmark in my " +
                "Christian development. It was during that time that He " +
                "revealed to me what I am sharing now.\n" +
                "   Remember earlier when we spoke about the Pharisees " +
                "being very diligent about fasting? In Luke 5:33-35 Jesus " +
                "responds to the disciples of John the Baptist who wants " +
                "to know why Jesus disciples do not fast. The answer " +
                "given by Jesus is the heart and soul of fasting. He said, " +
                "“Can you make the children of the bride chamber fast, " +
                "while the bridegroom is with them?” Then He said, “But " +
                "the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken " +
                "away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.”\n" +
                "   The more I have fasted the more I have longed for my " +
                "bridegroom to appear. The words “in those days” could " +
                "not have been more prophetic for the Church. We are " +
                "living in the day in which our every action must " +
                "demonstrate our total dependence upon the One to " +
                "whom our hearts belong.\n" +
                "   I recall once when I was fasting hearing the voice of " +
                "the Holy Spirit asking me how much I desired the " +
                "return of the only true King of Kings? I was puzzled by " +
                "the question and asked Him why He was asking me " +
                "this question. He proceeded to tell me that most of the " +
                "Church today was more interested in their kingdom " +
                "instead of His kingdom and that if the Church would " +
                "cry out for His return like the children of Israel cried for " +
                "a deliverer in Egypt that heaven would hear.\n" +
                "   I have had such wonderful experiences in my times of " +
                "fasting with the Lord that have changed my ways of " +
                "thinking and believing. My life is truly no longer mine to " +
                "do as I please. The most poignant understanding I have " +
                "had through fasting is the realization that what Jesus " +
                "did for me can not now or ever be repaid. This one truth " +
                "has made me determined to lay my life down for Him at " +
                "any price.\n" +
                "   It is my desire that all of you who desire to enter into " +
                "those places of intimacy with the Holy Spirit through " +
                "fasting will find the courage and faith to begin your life " +
                "of fasting for the bridegroom’s return. Once you make " +
                "the decision to begin you will never regret it.\n" +
                "   One of the many beautiful things about the Holy " +
                "Spirit is that He forgets your failures in the journey and " +
                "capitalizes on your successes.\n" +
                "   Our mind is the enemy of our spirit when the Holy " +
                "Spirit is not in control. There will not be too many " +
                "things in our life more difficult to achieve than fasting. " +
                "This is exactly why the Holy Spirit is giving us keys. " +
                "Remember, the first key is the level of your giving. " +
                "Have you become the gift? This will unlock the mystery " +
                "of prayer. W hen you can become the incense on the altar " +
                "of God, through your prayer life the next key is handed " +
                "to you.\n" +
                "   Always remember this journey we are taking is " +
                "progressive. Each step requires more intense time with " +
                "Him than before. This is to insure we do nothing routine " +
                "or familiar as to elicit a certain response from the Holy " +
                "Spirit. The secret place is called “secret” because it is " +
                "such each time we seek to enter. Every fast is different " +
                "and requires a new degree of sacrifice to destroy any " +
                "preconceived routine or result.\n" +
                "   The places the Holy Spirit wants to take each of us " +
                "willing to submit will require total surrender. These are " +
                "places in the spirit where love and truth reign supreme " +
                "and the mind has no influence. This is the place the devil " +
                "fears you’re attaining and the place where angels are at " +
                "your command. You were made before the creation of " +
                "the world for this position in the heavenly realm.\n" +
                "   I recall during one of my fasts that the Lord started to " +
                "reveal to me how our images have been formed. He " +
                "showed me that our senses have been poisoned by " +
                "wrong eating, seeing and hearing, thus altering the " +
                "chemicals in our bodies.\n" +
                "   These chemicals actually work to form the thoughts " +
                "and images in our brains. Once these thoughts are " +
                "damaged, the images are also corrupted. If we continue " +
                "to see the same corrupted images over and over, we " +
                "begin to believe they are true. W hatever we continually " +
                "hear we will believe, and whatever we continually see " +
                "we will move toward and imitate.\n" +
                "   Our minds play images in full stereo, so not only are " +
                "we seeing something; we are hearing the dialogue of fear " +
                "as well. These images are one of the primary influences " +
                "by which we make choices in our lives.\n" +
                "   These images also produce feelings of comfort or " +
                "pain. And, eventually over time, our senses and " +
                "emotions are so damaged that we need more and more " +
                "stimulation to have any feelings. This is why we are a " +
                "society of gluttons, not only in foods but violence and " +
                "every other form of self gratifications.\n" +
                "   Man has always lived by the old saying, “If it feels " +
                "good, do it.” We begin to trust all the wrong images and " +
                "thoughts created by wrong eating, wrong listening, and " +
                "wrong viewing. The more we engage in these types of " +
                "behavior the easier it is for us to believe the lies of the " +
                "enemy. The easier it is for us to be controlled by fear. " +
                "And the more difficult it is to hear anything from the " +
                "Holy Spirit.\n" +
                "   The Lord has shown me that fasting brings our body " +
                "under submission. But what the Holy Spirit is " +
                "ultimately after is bringing our thoughts into order. As " +
                "the Apostle Paul said:\n\n" +
                    "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but " +
                    "mighty through God to the pulling down of strong " +
                    "holds; casting down imaginations, and every high " +
                    "thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of " +
                    "God, and bringing into captivity every thought to " +
                    "the obedience of Christ.\n\n" +
                    "                            —2 Corinthians 10:4-5\n\n" +
                "   Fasting has many stages of development. One of those " +
                "is our being consumed by the thoughts of God. " +
                "Changing our thoughts requires seeing and hearing " +
                "different images.\n" +
                "   One way this is done is by removing the current " +
                "source of the stimulation and replacing it with another. " +
                "So taking away our current food source starts to clean " +
                "the mind of wrong images. This is how I began and I " +
                "think it can be useful for anyone serious about fasting.\n" +
                "   When we begin to forfeit food to spend more time " +
                "with the Holy Spirit, our distractions are diminished. " +
                "This does not happen immediately, but as a result of " +
                "learning how to give and pray, our success is faster. The " +
                "activities of our thoughts slow down for us to carefully " +
                "observe what is taking place in and around us. As this " +
                "happens we start to observe strange phenomena.\n" +
                "   Most of our thoughts are centered on only one or two " +
                "themes. Usually, we become consumed with some form " +
                "of self preservation and personal security. These themes " +
                "are almost always connected with money in some form " +
                "or other. This is a recurring thought even if it is " +
                "disguised in different forms.\n" +
                "   For example, when we are encouraged to “sow” into " +
                "the kingdom of God, the immediate thought preceding " +
                "giving is what will I reap? This is obvious; we spoke " +
                "earlier about this problem in the body of Christ. But " +
                "what is not so obvious is our subtle way of saying, “We " +
                "are not of this world” as a Christian Mantra, but making " +
                "decisions that are designed as though we are building " +
                "our kingdom on earth.\n" +
                "   For example, some years ago we were moving from " +
                "one millennium to the next. The body of Christ was " +
                "filled with warnings of disaster concerning the " +
                "infamous Y2K. I found myself being encouraged or even " +
                "warned by large ministries to buy gold and store food " +
                "for the looming disaster. This was coming from a group " +
                "of people who purported to have no ties with this world " +
                "or its system.\n\n" +
                    "For those who live according to the flesh set their " +
                    "minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live " +
                    "according to the Spirit set their minds on the things " +
                    "of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, " +
                    "but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. " +
                    "For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is " +
                    "hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law— " +
                    "indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh " +
                    "cannot please God.\n\n" +
                    "                                           —Romans 8:5-8\n\n" +
                "   This is the major strategy of the enemy. The enemy " +
                "knows that in the flesh and the arena of the mind, he is " +
                "the master of illusions. So he controls us with fear and " +
                "pain which totally close our spirits. The images of fear " +
                "have been rehearsed and “acted out” in our minds for " +
                "years. So much so that our hearts contain layers of scar " +
                "tissue protecting it from pain and rejection.\n" +
                "   The heart is turned to stone and our minds are filled " +
                "with images of failures, mistrust, and despair. So the " +
                "minute we attempt to leave the natural realm and move " +
                "to the spirit, our minds become filled with distractions. " +
                "If we can be distracted by the illusion of solving our " +
                "problems in our unreformed minds and cold harded " +
                "hearts, our outcome is failure and our threat to the devil " +
                "and his kingdom has been neutralized.\n" +
                "   Can you see the genius of Jesus laying out this design " +
                "in Matthew 6? He knows the power structure of the " +
                "enemy, so He knows how to dismantle it as well. " +
                "Remember, If we can see the design of God, we can see " +
                "the weakness of our enemy. This is why you will be " +
                "hearing the word reformation from the bride of Christ " +
                "in the days ahead.\n" +
                "   As I said fasting has several stages of development in\n" +
                "each one of us. The progress of our development is " +
                "directly proportionate to our levels of giving and " +
                "prayer. I am continually amazed how the Holy Spirit " +
                "will take me deeper into His spirit through fasting, after " +
                "I have just obeyed His instructions of giving or " +
                "interceding.\n" +
                "   Our giving to God begins to destroy our soul’s hold " +
                "over us through the fear of loss, greed or lust for power. " +
                "The purpose of this battle is for our heart. This is where " +
                "fear resides and builds walls for protection from the " +
                "pain of past failures. We have all been conditioned to " +
                "believe that if we have money, we will be secure, safe " +
                "and pain free. And if we do not have money we believe " +
                "the images and thoughts of destitution and fear created " +
                "from society and our “friends”.\n" +
                "   These are the images that arise from a heart and mind " +
                "that have not been transformed into His mind. These " +
                "structures begin to fall when our hearts are reformed " +
                "into the image of the One who bought and paid for us. " +
                "He paid a price we could never afford for a future we " +
                "certainly do not deserve. That is why He is so " +
                "determined for us to see all that is ours through the " +
                "cross.\n" +
                "   Next, Jesus shows us how to pray, which again " +
                "engages our soul. The soul is the battleground for all our " +
                "emotions, images, and choices. Our minds are at the " +
                "forefront in this battle because we like our comfort and " +
                "have been told “seeing is believing.” But we know that " +
                "believing what we can not see is the first step to seeing " +
                "in the spirit realm. This is why faith is never found in " +
                "our minds.\n" +
                "   Our mind requires proof from the natural realm " +
                "before it will believe. The sad thing about this scenario " +
                "is that most of the images our mind has been shown are " +
                "created from illusion. The devil has created false images " +
                "conditioned by the fears he has tormented us with, to " +
                "fool us into believing that what we are seeing in our " +

                "   This is why prayer requires destroying more of the " +
                "established structures. Prayer changes our mind by " +
                "focusing on heavenly images that have broken through " +
                "fear and doubt. The battle rages within us until " +
                "something begins to change.\n" +
                "   The change began from our encounter with giving " +
                "that allowed light to transform our hearts. These " +
                "changes are to eliminate some of the poisons those years " +
                "and years of conditioning have produced.\n" +
                "   Jesus knows the hearts and minds of man. He knows " +
                "what must be done to reform man the image of the " +
                "Father that was lost in the garden, must be reformed. " +
                "His methods are perfect\n" +
                "   Now we are introduced to fasting, the place where the " +
                "body really begins to squirm. The body has been " +
                "demanding its way for years. Now you are making the " +

                "are you kidding? Think of it, the entire structure of the " +
                "devil to control our every thought is under attack.\n" +
                "   It is important to note that the process is never the " +
                "same for each person. The only thing that is constant is " +
                "the importance of dismantling the strongholds. Jesus " +
                "our master designed this three-pronged attack to " +

                "   The soul must be free in order for us to become the " +
                "ultimate weapon against the devil. Remember when " +
                "Jesus said in John 14:30 that the “prince of this world " +
                "comes but has nothing in me.” This is the condition of " +
                "total victory, total authority, and complete dependence " +
                "on the King of Kings. This is something you and I can " +
                "achieve. The method is perfect and it will work if we are " +
                "willing to begin where we are.\n" +
                "   Before we move to the next part of Matthew, I would " +
                "like to show an example from the scripture of these three " +
                "keys in operation. Let’s look in Acts 10:30-32:\n\n" +
                    "And Cornelius said: “Four days ago I was fasting " +
                    "until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in " +
                    "my house, and behold, a man stood before me in " +
                    "bright clothing, and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer " +
                    "has been heard, and your alms are remembered in " +
                    "the sight of God. Send therefore to Joppa and call " +
                    "Simon here, whose surname is Peter.’”\n\n" +
                "   This is the story of how a religious apostle met a " +
                "spiritual heathen. How the heart of God was moved by " +
                "giving, praying and fasting regardless of the race of " +
                "Cornelius. The power of this man Cornelius was " +
                "demonstrated in every aspect of his soul.\n" +
                "   These are the characteristics that will cause Heaven to " +
                "open for us as it did him. W hat is so remarkable about " +
                "this account is how we see the operation of Matthew 6 " +
                "releasing the power of the Holy Ghost. The soul of this " +
                "man had been transformed long before Peter laid hands " +
                "on him.\n" +
                "   The giving and praying of this man had taken him to a " +
                "dimension in the spirit realm perpetuated by his fasting. " +
                "This is such a beautiful illustration of how to dismantle " +
                "every religious structure and image of our hearts and " +

                "   Cornelius, I believe, hastened the release of the Holy " +
                "Spirit to the gentiles. The amazing thing about the Holy " +
                "Ghost is that He will respond to anyone who responds " +
                "to His ways and methods.\n" +
                "   We must remember that one of the primary goals of " +
                "the Father is to destroy the evil that was released in the " +
                "Garden of Eden. The image of God was destroyed, and " +
                "the image of the devil was imprinted on our souls.\n" +
                "   So when God can find someone who is willing to give " +
                "at His leading, He will instruct the Holy Spirit to teach " +
                "that person how to pray. This is what took place with " +
                "Cornelius.\n\n" +
                "   Then while Cornelius was fasting, the scripture says " +
                "about the third hour he saw a vision. The number three " +
                "through out the Bible speaks of the Godhead as well as " +
                "completeness. I believe this was a sign to this “heathen” " +
                "that he was being made whole, spirit, soul, and body, " +
                "through his obedience and thirst after God.\n" +
                "   This illustration speaks volumes to me about how " +
                "much we can trust our Father with our very lives. It " +
                "does not matter what anyone or any religion says about " +
                "Jesus. It only matters that our hearts and minds are " +
                "transformed so that we can receive directly from the " +
                "source.\n" +
                "   But the source, the Holy Spirit, can not send us images " +
                "or sounds through a corrupted, unreformed receptor " +
                "such as our minds and hearts. So He shows us how to " +
                "clean our receptor, then He begins to educate us for " +
                "higher responsibilities in His kingdom.\n" +
                "   Cornelius was not only a high ranking officer in the " +
                "natural army but was immediately promoted in the " +
                "kingdom of God. His life caused the religious crowd to " +
                "submit to the power of the Holy Ghost. W hat an " +
                "awesome New Testament example of the power " +
                "structure contained in Matthew 6 and the faithfulness of " +
                "our Lord.\n" +
                "   In closing our subject on fasting, I want to share a few " +
                "observations that have been exposed to me at different " +
                "times of fasting.\n" +
                "   One such observation is how closely fasting and death " +
                "resemble each other. I have never been close to physical " +
                "death through fasting. Fasts of forty days are not life " +
                "threatening, particularly if we consume plenty of " +
                "liquids.\n" +
                "   But when I thought of Moses fasting 80 days " +
                "consecutively without water or food, I started to see " +
                "how meager my fasts have been. I am also convinced " +
                "that if we really want to move into the arena of the " +
                "spirit realm, fasting and death overlap.\n" +
                "   The term fasting has a sanitary spiritual connotation " +
                "that is lost when we take the step that Moses took. In " +
                "Moses’ mind he was already face to face with his " +
                "creator, so what difference did it make to him if his heart " +
                "was beating?\n" +
                "   Survival was only if he was interested in this planet. " +
                "W hat he was witnessing was beyond what the natural " +
                "realm could offer. Fasting or whatever Moses was " +
                "experiencing was a by-product of the transformation " +
                "process taking place.\n" +
                "   Imagine with me if you will, Moses standing inside " +
                "the cloud of God where there is no time, where the light " +
                "from God’s glory changed Moses very DNA. In fact it " +
                "was so profound I think that is why Satan wanted his " +
                "body. The transformation changed something in the " +
                "chemical makeup of Moses, to the point that he could " +
                "have lived, I believe like those of Adam’s generation.\n" +
                "   This body held secrets that God had buried in the " +
                "flood to keep Satan from obtaining them. This hidden " +
                "knowledge in the hands of demon possessed people such " +
                "as Hitler; Hussein and future anti-Christ’s could change " +
                "the destiny of some nations and peoples.\n" +
                "   God showed Moses every detail of the tabernacle in its " +
                "splendor and grand design. This design was more than a " +
                "tabernacle; it was God revealing to His servant His very " +
                "nature.\n" +
                "   Do you think we could become so immersed in the " +
                "Glory of God that all of our necessities would be " +

                "   We have already spoken about the process of " +
                "reformation that must begin from the heart of man " +
                "progressing outward to the physical body. This is " +
                "ultimately where the “rapture” will take place as far as I " +
                "am concerned. That is not main stream theology but it is " +
                "something to consider.\n" +
                "   My fasts have been frequent and life changing but not " +
                "even close to where the Lord is calling us. I believe that " +

                "I say lukewarm because we have not closed the door " +
                "on our belief that “maybe this Christianity thing won’t " +

                "   So we rationalize that if we only have one life to live " +
                "we better get all we can out of this world. Then our time " +

                "   The law of sin and death are a result of mans " +

                "and his future. The Father, knowing our predicament " +
                "made arrangements for our return to His image by the " +

                "   This transformation process is one of the most " +

                "to do it in 2 Corinthians 10:3. Then Jesus releases the " +

                "   The soul is the soil and the seeds are what we " +
                "continually hear. If we listen to doubt and unbelief we " +
                "will produce fruit inside of our souls that are full of " +
                "poisons, darkness and death. The heart which is our " +
                "believing center will be corrupted and unable to believe " +

                "soul, or his life will be a series of constant battles and " +

                "or conversations of expensive cars, expensive clothes, " +

                "   The distinction between images and pictures is " +

                "information than the heart or emotional centers of the " +
                "soul. This is why pictures may not be complete but like " +

                "operates by rewarding those who have mastered the " +
                "keys of giving, praying and fasting, with more authority " +

                "defeating the spirit of Mammon in our lives. Let’s follow " +
                "along in Matthew:\n\n" +
                    "No one can serve two masters; for either he will " +
                    "hate the one and love the other, or else he will be " +
                    "loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot " +
                    "serve God and Mammon.\n\n" +
                    "                               —Matthew 6: 24\n\n" +
                "  Why would Jesus put this verse in this place? We " +
                "have said all along, that God is a God of design, purpose " +
                "and timing. Jesus knew there was no reason to speak " +
                "about Mammon until we were equipped to defeat it.\n" +
                "   But He also knows the composition of the human " +
                "being, particularly the complexity of the soul. He knows " +
                "unless our soul and flesh are one with His Spirit, we are " +
                "helpless to change masters, or even recognize the " +
                "difference.\n\n" +
                    "What is the most important commandment? " +
                    "Jesus answered, The most important one says: " +
                    "“People of Israel, you have only one Lord and God. " +
                    "You must love him with all your heart, soul, mind, " +
                    "and strength.”\n\n" +
                    "                                  —Mark 12:28-30\n\n" +
                "   This statement is the heart of what we have been " +
                "discussing throughout our book.\n" +
                "   How can we love the Lord our God with all of our " +
                "being? How do we fix our soul and body (strength) to be " +
                "one with Him the way Jesus was one with His Father?\n" +
                "   We have said all along that Jesus in His infinite love " +
                "and wisdom developed the teachings found in Matthew " +
                "6 for this very reason. This is why we are developing " +
                "our lives of giving, praying and fasting, to repair our " +
                "souls.\n" +
                "   We have used each key to open chambers within our " +
                "minds and hearts to let the “light of the Holy Spirit” " +

                "   “So what exactly is Mammon?” you might say. Some " +
                "translations use the word “money” in place of " +
                "Mammon. This is not an accurate translation but " +
                "someone’s interpretation. Money has its own Greek " +
                "word and is used throughout the Scriptures. Mammon " +
                "is an Aramaic word which means, “That which is kept " +
                "safe, or secured.” Thus, because so many believe security " +
                "is in money, then it is easy to see how the translators " +
                "have interposed money for the true name of this spirit.\n" +
                "   However, Mammon is a spirit that manifests in " +
                "property, stocks, careers, or family connections or " +
                "anything which subtly guarantees and secures an " +
                "income. In ancient Israel, this spirit was the direct " +
                "equivalent to what we now call “savings.” A man’s " +
                "mammon was his bank account, his safety net against " +
                "the unforeseen. W hen a Jew of ancient Palestine referred " +
                "to his Mammon, he was speaking of that thing that " +
                "GUARANTEED his financial security. MAMMON IS " +
                "ANYTHING WE PUT OUR TRUST IN OTHER THAN " +
                "GOD. ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!\n" +
                "   Mammon is not necessarily money, but that which " +
                "gives the power to purchase what money can buy. It is a " +
                "type of promissory note that gives an illusion to it’s " +
                "owners of security and purchasing power. I say illusion " +
                "because if anyone who has read about or lived during " +
                "the great depression in the United States can see how " +
                "one day money had worth and the next day it did not. " +
                "This is one high price for serving Mammon.\n\n" +
                "MAMMON PERVERTS THE MESSAGE OF PROSPERITY\n" +
                "   So when Jesus compares God and Mammon, He is " +
                "referring to the system, which is a spirit, that competes " +
                "for the affection, worship, faith and attention of those " +
                "who say, “Lord, Lord.”\n" +
                "   All my Christian life I thought I was serving God. I " +
                "was a giver in tithes and offerings over and above 50% " +
                "of my income. At that time in my life I was making " +
                "several thousand dollars a month. I secretly began to " +
                "admire my giving to the point that pride and arrogance " +
                "became associated with my giving.\n" +
                "   I would choose carefully those ministers and " +
                "ministries to whom I would give or “sow” into. The " +
                "primary purpose that I gave to them was number one; I " +
                "was being nurtured and fed in my spiritual " +
                "development.\n" +
                "   These Men of God were very popular in the media and " +
                "throughout the world. I felt good about giving to " +
                "ministries that I could watch on TV and see how " +
                "millions of lives were being affected. The other reason " +
                "was, I believed that God would multiply back what I " +
                "gave. All of these ministers taught sowing and reaping.\n" +
                "   Sometimes that is all they taught. But there were other " +
                "benefits to giving into those ministries as well. I would " +
                "be recognized for the amount of my giving by special " +
                "seating at conferences, or I would be given so-called " +
                "private numbers directly to the ministers’ homes.\n" +
                "   The larger the gift the more the recognition and " +
                "special privileges. Some ministries would invite me to " +
                "become part of their “inner circle” of followers, which " +
                "allowed me access to selected meetings and trips with " +
                "them personally.\n" +
                "   I felt very privileged to have personal contacts with " +
                "some of the biggest personalities in the Christian and " +
                "Television world. Each of these men was serious about " +
                "their passion for Jesus and the hurting millions in the " +
                "world.\n" +
                "   But, the system being used to keep their ministries " +
                "going was creating something other than what was " +
                "intended. I observed that the people operating these " +
                "ministries were using the same techniques and " +
                "principles as common corporations of the world used.\n" +
                "   I watched as the same “Madison Avenue” slick " +
                "advertisement to sell cars, or elect politicians, was " +
                "employed to promote the conferences and persuade me " +
                "to give to these ministries.\n" +
                "   I received multiplied thousands of dollars in publicity " +
                "and newsletters a year from many ministries that I was " +
                "supporting. The bigger ones were like a corporation, " +
                "who had to have more and more money to operate their " +
                "many departments and expenses.\n" +
                "   The men of God became more like CEO’s of huge " +
                "enterprises, than what I had imagined an evangelist, " +
                "healer or teacher of the gospel should be. I am not " +
                "intending to judge anyone here. I am relating my " +
                "feelings, and what God was teaching me about my heart " +
                "and about the system of Mammon.\n" +
                "   I began to feel like giving entitled me to get from God. " +
                "In fact I was starting to get subliminal messages from " +
                "these ministries that having money was a sign of " +
                "righteousness.\n" +
                "   I began to feel that because I was not receiving “the " +
                "hundredfold return,” there must have been something " +
                "wrong in my spiritual life. I believed that those who had " +
                "lots of money had great faith. After all, some ministries " +
                "talked extensively about how many planes they owned " +
                "and had given away in their lives.\n" +
                "   I never met one person who received a hundredfold " +
                "from their giving. There might be many. I just have not " +
                "heard or read of any.\n" +
                "   But in the circles that I frequented that message, " +
                "which has since been replaced with the “thousand fold,” " +
                "was the most popular teaching presented before an " +
                "offering was taken.\n" +
                "   There was not one person among us who did not " +
                "think after giving in that offering, that we would be " +
                "entitled to receive what would be equivalent to the " +
                "lottery. That is how corrupted my heart had become " +
                "from thinking about being prosperous.\n" +
                "   Let me make this clear, I believe each of those men to " +
                "be absolutely convinced God was being honored in their " +
                "lives and ministries. Indeed, all of these men are " +
                "precious saints of God full of integrity and I am not their " +
                "judge.\n" +
                "   Moreover, I would not even have reached the first step " +
                "of giving had it not been for the messages from these " +
                "men of God.\n" +
                "   We are living in a new generation that must hear and " +
                "see much more the nature and true character of God.\n" +
                "   I am convinced that God initiated the so-called " +
                "“prosperity” message for a major reason. That reason is " +
                "because the Church did and in many places still does " +
                "not, give.\n" +
                "   The Church is still so bound up in Mammon that " +
                "many of its members do not even tithe. So God had to " +
                "show the Church through His mercy that He is a " +
                "rewarder of those who will diligent seek Him, even if it " +
                "is in the most elementary ways, such as giving.\n" +
                "   I began to notice over a period of several months that " +
                "my business was “drying up.” The business that I " +
                "believed God had blessed as a result of my giving to His " +
                "work was becoming like the “brook of Cherith” in 1 " +
                "Kings 17:7.\n" +
                "   Then one day my money ran out. I had not done " +
                "anything differently. I was giving all that I had to the " +
                "ministries who were regularly asking, sometimes two " +
                "and three times a month.\n" +
                "   But my business was not producing any income. I " +
                "was self-employed and relied on what I thought was " +
                "God to prosper me. “W hat is wrong? Lord, I asked. I " +
                "heard nothing from the Holy Spirit.\n" +
                "   During those years of giving tens of thousands of " +
                "dollars, I had gone to many nations. I had prayed for the " +
                "sick and had seen miracles. I prophesied and cast out " +
                "devils and even preached. I was truly being used by God " +
                "and felt His presence often. So why was I not receiving " +
                "the hundredfold returns as promised? W hy had my " +
                "prayers for money gone unanswered?\n" +
                "   Then the Holy Spirit said,: “Read the following " +
                "scriptures: Matthew 7:20-24” This speaks about those " +
                "who had cast out devils, prophesied and done miracles " +
                "in His name. But He told them, “DEPART FROM ME, I " +
                "NEV ER KNEW YOU, FOR YOUR PRACTICE IS EV IL IN " +
                "MY EYES.”\n" +
                "   Then the Holy Spirit said clearly, “your master is " +
                "Mammon not me.” I was absolutely devastated. How " +
                "could this be? I knew I had heard the Holy Spirit tell me " +
                "to give to these ministries. I knew that my “sowing” " +
                "entitled me to “reaping” according to the Bible. I knew " +
                "all of these truths.\n" +
                "   However, more times than not the hidden motivation " +
                "is for our “financial security.” This is where our " +
                "deception begins and the transfer of allegiance from one " +

                "   But my giving was to a disguised system from a " +

                "   That was “a truth” alright but I for one did not know " +
                "the difference. I was also taught that God could use my " +

                "scriptures. Yet it is the most insidious devil on this " +
                "planet.\n" +
                "   One way Jesus showed the world He would not be " +
                "controlled by Mammon was to make Judas the ministry " +
                "treasurer. How many ministers do you know who " +
                "would look for a thief among their faithful followers and " +
                "appoint him the guardian of the money? Jesus made a " +
                "powerful statement, by doing this. Jesus understood His " +
                "mission on the earth and showed His disciples how to " +
                "establish His Father’s Kingdom without bowing to " +
                "Mammon.\n" +
                "   We just read we can not serve two masters, because " +
                "we will hate the one and love the other. This is because " +
                "masters require undivided attention from their " +
                "disciples. Jesus said “a house divided cannot stand.”\n" +
                "   The truth is, many of the so-called Christians, in " +
                "reality do not love Jesus. They like Jesus but they love " +
                "money. It is a sad thing to learn that those who profess " +
                "to love Jesus in essence hate Him.\n" +
                "   If we are bowing our knee to Mammon we hate Jesus. " +
                "The Scripture makes it clear that we love one and hate " +
                "the other. As you continue to read, you will see the " +
                "seriousness of our betrayal. Judas only got thirty pieces " +
                "of silver. What are we selling out for?\n" +
                "   Why would Jesus ask Peter three times in John 21:15- " +
                "17 if he loved Him? Jesus was using the Greek word for " +
                "love, Agape, which means unselfish love. Peter was " +
                "responding with the Greek word Phileo, which means " +
                "affection without demonstration. The reason, as we " +
                "have discussed before, is that love requires action. But " +
                "liking someone does not demand a response from us.\n" +
                "   Is it any wonder Jesus began His discourse in " +
                "Matthew 6 with giving as the first and foremost sign of " +
                "expressing what one verbalizes?\n" +
                "   I learned it was not giving that was my problem, but " +
                "the motive behind the gift. That was and is what is " +
                "wrong with messages on prosperity today. " +
                "Giving is truly the beginning of all beginnings when it " +
                "comes to demonstrating who we serve. But why we give " +
                "will separate the wheat from the chaff, or God from " +
                "Mammon.\n" +
                "   We find in 1 Timothy 6:10 that the love of money is " +
                "the root of all evil. This tells me that if someone is having " +
                "problems in his life he should investigate the roots of the " +
                "“flowering problems.”\n" +
                "   According to this Scripture we will discover that the " +
                "love of money is the cause. This is Mammon controlling " +
                "our lives and our attention.\n\n" +
                "   Where your treasure is, there will be your heart also.\n\n" +
                "   Let’s be honest with ourselves and uncover why we" +
                "do what we do.\n" +
                "   Money decides how we dress so we can get that " +
                "certain job. If we befriend certain people because of their " +
                "influence and connections, then money is deciding who " +
                "our friends are.\n" +
                "   If we work extra long hours to maintain a lifestyle, " +
                "then money is deciding how much time we will spend " +
                "with our family.\n" +
                "   If our wife works so we can be wealthier, then money " +
                "has decided that our children are better off with " +
                "someone other than their mother.\n" +
                "If we attend Churches whose main messages are " +
                "prosperity and words that focus on me getting my " +
                "needs met, then money and self are my motives, not " +
                "what God might be saying to the nations.\n" +
                "   The list goes on and on. Sermons that alter the very " +
                "heart of the true gospel are negotiated with, in order " +
                "that we might gain.\n" +
                "   We are living in the age that can be described as " +
                "Modern Apostate Christendom, which simply means " +
                "willfully and purposely rejecting the teachings of Jesus.\n" +
                "   Jesus said to seek first His kingdom and His " +
                "righteousness and all these things shall be added but " +
                "Mammon and the “Apostate Christendom” say, “Seek " +
                "first financial security, and then you will have both time " +
                "and money to give to the kingdom of God.”\n" +
                "   Apostate Christendom dressed up in the modern day " +
                "prosperity message, has rewritten the scriptures into " +
                "respectable “practical wisdom” about our finances. " +
                "There seems to be a subliminal message, that gain is " +
                "associated with super faith.\n\n" +
                       "The statements Jesus makes in Matthew 6:25-33 are " +
                    "clear and uncompromising.  " +
                    "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, " +
                    "what you will eat or what you will drink, or about " +
                    "your body, what you will wear. Is not life more " +
                    "than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at " +
                    "the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor " +
                    "gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father " +
                    "feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? " +
                    "And can any of you by worrying add a single hour " +
                    "to your span of life? And why do you worry about " +
                    "clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they " +
                    "grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even " +
                    "Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of " +
                    "these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, " +
                    "which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into " +
                    "the oven, will he not much more clothe you—you of " +
                    "little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, “W hat " +
                    "will we eat?” or “W hat will we drink” or “W hat " +
                    "will we wear?” For it is the Gentiles who strive for " +
                    "all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father " +
                    "knows that you need all these things. But strive first " +
                    "for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and " +
                    "all these things will be given to you as well.\n\n" +
                "   Most of those words have become meaningless in " +
                "Churches whose goals are primarily focused on " +
                "prosperity. If anyone were dare to speak or act in the " +
                "ways described above (take no thought for tomorrow), " +
                "he would be labeled irresponsible, regarded unreliable " +
                "and dismissed as a fool.\n" +
                "   Verse 26 plainly states that our living is not " +

                "dependent upon our savings, but is solely dependent " +
                "upon who our Father is.\n" +
                "   Nevertheless, many modern day prophets and " +
                "apostles speak about prosperity and wealth transfers as " +
                "if they were the captain on the Titanic, imploring their " +

                "principles because of what we call “reality,” is to live in " +

                "   Many of us believe that the attack on the twin towers " +
                "in New York, September 11, 2001 was God, telling us " +

                "require another book to explore them all. Let me point " +
                "out some things relevant to our study.\n" +
                "   God hates the system of Babylon. It is the system of " +
                "Mammon perpetrated by buying and selling and it is " +
                "built upon covetousness and greed.\n" +
                "   As much as God loves Man, He hates evil more, which " +
                "He demonstrates by the deaths of the innocent soldiers " +
                "as the consequence of the sin of Achan.\n" +
                "   When Jesus told the Pharisees who were covetous " +
                "that what they found valuable was an abomination to " +
                "God, it was not because of the gold, silver and bronze " +
                "but because of their hearts. It is not the gold and silver " +
                "that was wrong. It is to what master they are " +
                "consecrated.\n" +
                "   Jesus drove the robbers and thieves from the temple " +
                "because of their hearts and the god they served. " +
                "Remember, we are His temple, and He is a jealous God.\n" +
                "   In my life I refuse to buy what I don’t need, and I will " +
                "not sell what I don’t want. I prefer to give away what " +
                "still has value. I believe many Christians live this way " +
                "but there are some who are preoccupied with buying " +
                "and selling.\n" +
                "   The book of Revelation 13:17 makes a very strong " +
                "statements: So that no one can buy or sell who does not " +
                "have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the " +
                "number of its name.\n" +
                "   As I said earlier the terms buying and selling do not " +
                "make you the servant of Mammon but our hearts " +
                "demonstrate which is our master, the beast or Jesus The " +
                "Christ.\n" +
                "   This means to me, that if we, as the true body of " +
                "Christ do not learn how to operate in the supernatural, " +
                "we will be martyred or bow to the idol, which I believe " +
                "is Mammon..\n" +
                "  I am convinced that sowing and reaping is the way of " +
                "supplying the needs of the kingdom of God. " +
                "Unfortunately, many of the ministries who are adept at " +
                "using these terms do not operate under these principles. " +
                "In most cases, their methods of sowing and reaping " +
                "are mingled with the “commerce system of the world.”\n" +
                "   The machinery of the ministry has become so " +
                "conformed to the systems of the world that in order to " +
                "do business they begin to rely on wrong models. " +
                "Confidence subtly shifts from faith in God to faith in " +
                "proven business principles. The results are temporarily " +
                "sound and effective for the purpose of saving money. " +
                "This allows the Ministries to preach the gospel to the " +
                "lost, which appears good. But what we are finding is " +
                "real problems. “The lost” the major ministries are " +
                "converting, sadly fail to come out from the system of " +
                "Mammon. The real tragedy is that they really do not " +
                "even know the difference between the two Kingdoms.\n" +
                "   The new converts are trained more by what they see " +
                "than what they hear. The ministers are preaching true " +
                "principles from the word of God. But the converts see " +
                "most of the ministries on TV always asking for money. " +
                "They see the methods the Christian Church is using to " +
                "“raise funds.” and see little if any difference with other " +
                "worldly fund raising events, other than the promise of " +
                "getting a return on your gift.\n" +
                "   The so called Christians they produce are hybrid " +
                "forms of the world system. They become trained in " +
                "Church language and appearances without changing " +
                "the allegiances to the god they have been serving, " +
                "Mammon. This is not a condemnation but the sad truth " +
                "for many of the Churches in the Western world.\n" +
                "   The need for money is real. The hearts of the ministers " +
                "are pure for the most part. But because we have all " +
                "drunk from the cup of abominations spoken of in " +
                "Revelation 17:2, we are intoxicated with ideas and " +
                "methods from this world.\n" +
                "   We are all to blame for the condition of the Church. " +
                "We all feel helpless to change the overpowering demand " +
                "of more and more money to feed “the machine.”\n" +
                "    So the question we must all answer is how can we live " +
                "in this world and not conform to its systems and " +
                "methods of doing business?\n\n" +

                    "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become " +
                    "a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul " +
                    "spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird! " +
                    "For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the " +
                    "wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have " +
                    "committed fornication with her, and the merchants " +
                    "of the earth have become rich through the " +

                    "lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her " +

                "Luke 16 that if we are faithful with unrighteous " +
                "Mammon we will graduate to receive “true riches.” The " +
                "true riches are not material, such as gold and silver, but " +
                "rather our trust in the Holy Spirit contained within our " +

                    "And if you are untrustworthy about worldly " +

                "   As hard as this is to say, the only reason we as the " +

                "  You notice how Satan quoted scriptures to show us " +

                "for me took Him through Gethsemane to the cross. " +
                "Someone as unworthy as me could capture the Father’s " +

                "  The more I studied chapter 6 of Matthew, the more I " +
                "could see the design of prayer. Real prayer is not " +
                "possible without first understanding giving. The truth " +
                "is that the Church, who longs to walk in the power of " +
                "prayer, has been hindered because of their " +
                "unwillingness to give.\n" +
                "  Prayer, the backbone of our life with God, has been " +
                "void of any real power. This is because we are a Church " +
                "that is selfish and stingy with something that does not " +
                "even belong to us.\n" +

                "How this prayer released a religious man name Saul " +
                "into a spiritual giant named Paul. How the destiny of " +
                "Stephen was fulfilled through the life of Paul. The depths " +
                "of a man’s prayers are not limited to the temporal time " +
                "he lives on the earth. For example when Moses asked " +
                "God to show him His glory, God allowed Moses to see " +

                "   This I believe is for many reasons, but primarily it is " +
                "because the major weapon of the enemy is neutralized " +

                "hardened hearts. These keys can open the doors but we " +
